*”…She’d never been to Hà Binh, much less Sampaguita or Phisit. Nor did she particularly want to, but such is life. It didn’t help that the closest landmass next to her just so happened to be Phisit.
[Gamma](../Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) sighs again, and adjusts [Nea](../Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) who had begun to fall off again.

How’d they even make it to Phisit? Hà Binh was at least a three-day trip from where they were originally, or at least where she thought they were. 

But, the undeniable smell of rotting fish and burning spices lingered in the air. Phisit was in front of her whether she liked it or not… 

Gamma checks her watch. 7AM. How long had she been walking? oh well. 

She takes a big, deep breath, and shuffles meekly into Phisit. 

Quite honestly, it was just as smelly as she’d imagined it would be. It was hot, even at 7… 8… 9 AM. Humid and sweaty, but also quite charming, as she’d come to realize. There was a certain thing with vendors completely ignoring the entity on your back while they yelled in foreign languages. There was also no border security awake at the time which she found quite nice.

But honestly, the smell of spices, fish, and manure were better than rusting metal, so she’d much preferred it. Even Nea began to stir, upon passing the walls of cured meat and drying insects.”*

The home to [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) and [Honeycakes](../Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md). 

Most similar to present day Baguio and Bontoc. 

# Phisit

### Sampaguita 

*the street market*
	Because quite honestly, that’s all it’s known for. It's hot and humid and smells mostly of cured meat. It's very crowded and everyone is prone to robbing and mugging. Despite that, the community is generally happy, and the buildings are colorful (despite the mold). What the place lacks in cleanliness it makes up for in soul.

### Ngima 

*Up in the mountains..*
	The hometown to [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md). A smelly mountain which was built up upon mounds of trash and scrap metal. It was home to a long lost tribe, who left a cavern of intricate tunnels and strange statues along with it. They have mostly been covered and filled due to landslides, but particularly daring historians enjoy digging through it.

	 Ngima is too far up for any locals to get to/from Sampaguita, which just so happens to be right next to it, so they remain in itself.

	Ngima is quite the poor country. Most of its residents live in small houses of scrap metal, which are stacked up on top of each other. Electricity is mostly shared between houses and under a strict curfew. While there are “laws”, the law enforcement isn’t particularly fond of going up and down the hill to Ngima. It’s an extremely religious community known for its very *very* low living standards and lack of almost everything. 

	Ngima’s denizens usually receive food from either monthly trips to Sampaguita, or from airplanes. 

	all buildings are on a large, steep hill, almost basically 50-60 degrees. The vendors and houses who live on it support themselves upright using various pieces of metal, scrap, and children’s textbooks. When it rains, the place is basically off limits because it turns into a  glorified water slide.

	If you were to look up at the sky in Ngima, you’d see the desolate, grey sky, the wires, and then a cicada would probably fly into your mouth, so don’t do that. It’s a very gloomy place. 

[Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) lived near the top of Ngima so he wasn’t very socialized. 

When [Honeycakes](../Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) found out that [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) lived in Ngima, she considered leaving [Gamma](../Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and [Nea](../Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)

“*The sky’s bout as blue as an old, rotting car. It’s got some tints of you imagine hard enough, but the exterior’s too much brown and grey to see much of anything. 

Little pebbles of sticky, green slush trickle down from the sky, pittering and pattering on the rusty roofing’s of Sampaguita’s houses.he air is thick with the stench of iron and sour lemons. The fog blankets down on Ngima like a thick coating of glue. Despite it, there’s still the familiar shouts of marketkeep within their enclosed bubbles. 

The bubbles were nothing special. Some clear, semi-permeable membrane they all set up. Allows in large life forms, but no bugs and rain. The steam from the meat hovers at the top, obscuring the view of the vendors. 

Ngima’s set up on this 70 degree plane, so he’s surprised that anyone still lives here. He’s more so surprised that he’s walking up this goddamn hill with the rain against him. But so were the schoolchildren. So were the salarymen. He was nothing special. The bubbles were held upright by leaking cardboard boxes and old children’s textbooks, obscuring the buildings they sat in front of.”*

### Gouha

*The not-so-smelly area.*
	well, of course! It was created for corporations after all..



## Notable locations: 

***Iron Lantern Street Grill*** 
	*[Honeycakes](../Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md)’ work area. Home of [Regina n Sam](../Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Regina n Sam.md).

***Statue of Nebai***
	“*From the two-armed statue of Nebai, she sees the sun. It was designed as one of their landmarks, where the sun would go up and down all 12 arms of Nebai. However you had to stay at a specific spot, which just so happened to be mostly covered up by buildings, so the whole thing was quite useless. At least she could make out the sun at this point.”*

	A statue created in the honor of Nebai, a god in (insert religion here). one of the most notable landmarks in Phisit, despite how incompetently it was created. It is truly a work of art, though, with intricate carvings all along the body and hair of the goddess, made by various craftsman. Her clothes were made of shards from various historical artifacts and pottery.
