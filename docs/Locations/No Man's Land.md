- abbreviated to “NML” usually.
    The remaining 75% of Earth from the Rapture, which is more like 30% now. This is mostly because from science either reversing the effects, or people just building over it no matter what.
    - It’s infested with deep and lush forests, but it’s simply too dangerous for anyone to really survive out for long. Also, thirty percent of Earth is HUGE.
        - This is why being exiled is so powerful. Because outside of the forests is simply _nothing_.
            - No one knows what’s beyond No Man’s Land outside of a few abandoned experiments who roam around devouring the exiled. Prodigal is one.
        - Being exiled is quite literally worse than the death penalty.
    - Aerial shots show that no man’s land has “layers”.
        - From closest to current society, it goes:
            - Forests, swamps, and finally to a black stain near the top of the Earth, and a hideously large mountain. That is where God fell.
    - There are rumors of people who live in No Man’s Land.
        - There are a lot of fairy tales about this! People like Vincent the Great and the series’ “Intergalactic Wings” and “Managohr” both take place or draw heavy inspiration from NML.
        - Tbh NML is more of a joke than a real thing, due to how rare Exilation is.
            - “Haha! You’re gonna be sent to No Man’s Land! Don’t say that!”
            - “No Man’s Land’s better than this!!”
    - Fun fact: [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) is the only person to travel NML and _live_. Versailles, the old temple, was there.
    - Also, [Pyrrhon](/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) and other scientists are just too scared to go to NML. They dont know what happened since nature mutated uncontrollably since that time.
    - A few people live in NML actually, but they’re more of ‘gangs’ than real ‘towns’. They also all die.
    - It has no laws so it appeals to a few people who actualy survive. They’re like Amish people but extremely violent
