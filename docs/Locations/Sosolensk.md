*Sosolensk isn’t really known as being the fanciest place around, but it is most certainly known for those who live in it. A former battlefield for Pyrrhon now turned into the coldest country. Similarly to current day Russia, most Sosolensk denizens are portrayed as cold, strong, and incredibly intimidating.*
It’s up in the snowy mountains, up in the center. It’s much flatter and more prosperous than [Hà-Binh](Hà-Binh.md), known for its rich architecture and strict culture. Living conditions aren’t as awful as [ Ngima](Hà-Binh.md) but, they’re not too great either (depending on where you go). Sosolensk is sort of like Hawaii, the hot stop vacation for white girls pretending to be adventurous. 

Larger areas like Pyatinsty and Shaskala are much more inhabitable, but there are cities and people who live deep in the mountains hunting frozen meat.

### Pyatintsy

The ice palace

The place of rumors! Somewhere deep in the less populated areas of Sosolensk, mostly of for tribal people and extreme explorers. A gorgeous place, if you do have the balls to explore it. Many monks go there for their final test of religious training.

There’s little to no technology, frozen rivers and almost no warmth. Many people do, in fact, die here. You’ve seen those ice bars and those buildings made of ice? That’s Pyatintsy. 

People do permanently live here, but very little of them do. They typically eat raw meats and fend for themselves. Tribal infighting is rare here, despite the four tribes which do live there. 

### Astanrog

Fortress of God

Far away from Pyatintsy, a mountainous region with tunnels inside of it. This, however, is the headquarters of all monks and religious folk. 

### Shaskala

Corpo Palace

### Bylesk 

Home of the monks.

	this is where Khan had originally lived, a large mausoleum/monestary for monks and other religious figures. The whole monestary is dug deep into the mountains, a large connection of various tunnels. The whole interior of the mountain is inhabitable, almost like its own city. One of the wonrders of the world, since most of it is built with wood and little technology.

	Currently fighting with Pyatintsy politically.

	While people often go to Bylesk as their secondary vacation spot, most of the inhabitants are very secretive and absolutely hate tourists. However 75% of their funding comes from that so they’re just passively racist instead of actively against them.
