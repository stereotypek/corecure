A building thats so incredibly large.

- The colosseum, it’s called. Head of entertainment and manufacturing.
    - Since it has a mass amount of factories, to cut down on transportation costs, most of the shops compressed into the nearby area.

        - A lot of people also steal their stuff and sell it in the underground for a cheaper price, but sometimes they’ll tamper with it.

    - This is where the National Guardian Association holds their annual competition and where the Slaughterhouse’s HQ resides.

        - Very very high end area, looks quite clean but most of everything is just shoved underground/Into the oceans/into other domes. Mostly rich people live here, everything is really overpriced.

            - It looks like the Singapore airport and the entire LA combined.

- Outskirts are mostly casinos, cheap bars, sex hotels, and low-end shops. It also leads to the most accessible Underground area. A lot of druggies and homeless people who’ve gone into debt live around this area, but not much is really done about it.
    - If you go shopping, this is the place to go. But it’s very dirty and dusty.

- Middome is where the residential area is and recreation. This includes shops, parks, amusement parks, hotels, restaurants, etc.
    - It’s the largest Middome anywhere.

- Innerdome is the ENTIRE colosseum. I kid you not. It’s so large it’s so fucking big dude it has HOTELS inside of it, it has RESTAURANTS it has SHOPS it has CASINOS dude like 50% of the Innerdome is for spectators.
    - Smallest and most accessible innerdome available.

- While it has the size of a normal dome, not many people consider it a _dome_ because of how little is done there.
    - The majority of people on Earth have visited Dome 3 Once due to how easily accessible _everythi_n_g_ is (prices and taxes not included).
