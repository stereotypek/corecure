Stands for “The Last Hope”

## The Slaughterhouse

Shenx’s bar.

	“*Like most days in the Slaughterhouse, it’s hot, sticky, and sweaty.*

	*Shenx hadn’t picked the most ideal environment for a bar. It’s almost always raining, despite the hideous heat, bringing with it an awful humidity which clung to Constantine’s clothes and made his shirt stick to his skin like glue. It reeked of the manure and rotting bodies of mice and insects from the nearby sewers, with mud and other bones pooled up near the entrance.*

	*it was placed at the end of a long, swooping hill, which meant any and all rain practically flooded Shenx’s poor room. Perhaps that’s why the rent was so low,  but Shenx (despite everyone’s protests) didn’t mind, and neither did the old men who went there. Probably because they were so old and rotted anyway, so they couldn’t even smell— let alone taste the state of Shenx’s drinks and Shou’s food to begin with. They just liked the drama.*

	*And so here lies Constantine, as the rain titters outside on the flimsy, steel roof, fat drops of blood-tinted rain seeping down into a rusty bucket near the floor.* 

	*Constantine nudges the outlet of his computer. He was kind of surprised that electricity still ran in this glorified tent.* 

	*“Mmmm,” Shenx says, slipping up behind him. His wheelchair hums, brushing cold air against his legs. Shenx floats up, peering into the laptops screen. “Hacking?”*

	*“No,” Constantine said flatly. “Software updates.”*

	*“Uh huh, sure.”*

Right now [TLH](TLH.md) operates out of his bar, The Slaughterhouse. Sho works there as a chef. Shes unironically good at her job, she just hates talking to people. When you talk to her in game, it takes of -1 HP

[TLH](TLH.md) has actually made some progress dismantling Pyrrhon's power (particularly in their area and in the underground). It's all under the table deals, so people are currently under the assumption that TLH had ended a very long time ago and never exists. 

## Goal 

Um.

Well, they are essentially an intel brokerage company. They sell data and information, and use it to extort/blackmail people. Their primary way of doing this is through cybercrime, but they have other methods too. 

[Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) in particular is the leader of their cybercrime department, working with other people like [Sho](../Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Sho.md) to develop, refine and deploy ransomware. They do RAAS but their rates can be quite high. 

However, cybercrime isn’t their only method of getting information. For one, they have Gamma and a few others. Sometimes, they will physically go to the servers OR just torture the people straight up until they get what they want. This delves into the ‘hit man’ portion of TLH, which is their other sector.

### Goldfish

The brains

Lead by [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md), this is the cybercrime network.

Goldfish is the name of the cyber crime section that Constantine runs.

He mainly works in ransomware and double exploitation. TLH can be classified as a hacktivist group, but that isn't really what they do. 

[Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) does run the goldfish operation but he does have a team. Unlike freelancers, he and a few other members live in tlh for stable employment and forcefulnesss to remain employed.

Gamma helps sometimes with immersion missions in which she deploys the payload directly into the server itself, and Constantine mostly does the remote work.

They sell out their botnet and are popular amongst nerds for their ransomware which you can pay for.

The thing with their ransomware is that they store a copy of your data no matter what. If you pay and yoy get it back, they still have your data and will use it as an additional source of income by selling it to competitors.

If you don't pay, they'll release it to the main internet for everyone to see.

[Sho](../Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Sho.md) employs the man in the middle scams, the phishing  the ftp and the bank fraud (like zeus).

[Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) always targets the groups with very little technical knowledge and old companies first, then chisels (like the hit program) away at the newer ones.

[Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) was caught once, because he used the same VPN multiple times and the government caught up to him.

However [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) is actually an undocumented citizen like anywhere, so he was able to get away and someone else died in his place.

Goldfish, or at least [Constantine](../Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md), refuses to target healthcare unless he's paid generously for exploiting them

Goldfish fluctuates in member count, but the general number is 60-100. A few core (haha) members do live physically with Shenx as additional protection and pressure. 

### Lockpick 

The brawn.

Lead primarily by [Clementine](../Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Clementine.md) and A few others, this is like the “fixer” division. The hitman dirty work. this is also where Gamma gets most of her work, but not all of it. 

Lockpick is mostly by request, either by Goldfish or if they’re commissioned to do a job. It’s really straightforward, I don’t have much else to say about it. 

They always send photo proof of the job being done. If the mercenary is killed and fails the job, another is sent until it works. For each mercenary sent, there is a +10% up charge. this Isn’t really common though.
