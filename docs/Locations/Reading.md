a brief introduction on how to read the location system in CORE.

Now, a typical business card might look something like this: 
“*Great    Food! Nice  Snacks!* 
*Iron  Lantern   Street Grlil*
*Reel , autentic   meat  at 50% price!! Come check on  out  us.*
*Sampaguita, Phisit; HBNH - DN3807.*”
… with better English, most of the time.

The code at the bottom describes the exact location.

From largest to smallest, it goes from
[Hà-Binh](/Locations/Hà-Binh.md), a country
Phisit, a county 
Sampaguita, a city
DN(code), direct address within that city.

- DN stands for District Number. The code works like this: 
	- First three letters are for the exact street. in this case, street 38.
	- The other two are for where the building is exactly located. 07 means that it is the seventh building from the right side.
