Sep 18; Updated the res (github), cleaned up the account, and moved Obsidian to work exclusively on my laptop. fixed links (esp for [Hà-Binh](/Locations/Hà-Binh.md)). Fixed instances for [Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) and cleaned up some links. Updated [General Worldbuilding](/Bits/Worldbuilding/General Worldbuilding.md) and [SideQuests](/Bits/Game Mechanics/SideQuests.md).

DO NOTE THAT I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE ANYONE ACTUALLY READING THIS, so a lot of information lacks context. If you're ever so inclined, include the paragraph and I'll include context because frankly there is a LOT

God is dead.
We killed him.
The Earth is inhabited by mutated trees, insects, and disease-ridden fish.
From greed came war, and from war came disease.
Plants and Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body.
The only things left were the insects which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures.
They’d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought.
In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End.
The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens.
The rapture had begun.
Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it’s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped.
> 	`As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton. The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God. It’s the ultimate mothers womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it.`
> 	`There was a small girl inside of it.`
>     `Her name was Kei.`

The last living ruler of Beau’s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger.
A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis.
That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon’s Golden Rule.
She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch.
Everything seemed fine.
And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant.
> 	`Everything has since been stuffed under the rug.`  
> 	`With each disease cured, came millions of dead bodies.`
> 	`With each city liberated, came another pointless regulation.`
>     `Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug.`  
>     `To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too.`  

With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning.
Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously young, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been.
With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person.
Pyrrhon.
From her goal of reversing Beau’s tyranny, she had become even worse.
It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous ‘clone army’.
This marked the years until now as “The Age of Eugenics”, because that’s what it was and still is.
And everything’s crumbling, all the same.

#### tl;dr
Anyway, think of LA and New York. Compress it into a really awful city.
Think of the Earth. Take out 75% of it and then replace it with your LA/NY concoction. That is CORE.
CORE’s this platformer hack-n-slasher which takes place in an ugly cyberpunk landscape. While in the small corners of the Earth, there remain tribes and temples, most of the world has been overrun by capitalism and war. 

It’s known as the Age of Eugenics, all run under [Pyrrhon](/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md): a 200-year-old dictator who looks suspiciously like a 20 year old woman. When she’s not imposing laws or censoring opinions, you’ll find her with a test tube and a nucleus, in hopes of discovering immortality.
[Pyrrhon](/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) is a clone fanatic. She found the perfectly genetic being, or at least what she thought was the perfectly genetic being, and cloned and cloned and *cloned* until the Earth was overrun with them.
The Earth is dying. But who really cares about that, anyway? Because once she destroys and rebuilds Earth in *her perfect image*, everything’s going to be okay..

More can be found somewhere in [Early History](/Bits/Worldbuilding/Early History.md)


# What the fuck are you talking about
- god died
- humans died
- world repopulated by stickfigures
- history repeats itself
- pyrrhon discovers immortality
- She clones herself and others
- "To prevent war i'm going to kill everyone and fill the earth with perfect beings, my clones"
- profit

If you're interested in a more in-depth explanation, uh, I’ll write it eventually. And if you want more about cloning head to  [Cloning](/Bits/Worldbuilding/Cloning.md).  If youre interested in the very beginning of the story read [Prequel](/Bits/Story/Prequel.md). 
Do note that if you read prequel, most of it is entirely irrelevant to the main story. Except for a few notable parts. However if you’d like to read the story in chronological order, then the prequel is a nice place to start. If not, um, then you can read the individual character descriptions..
# Who is Pyrrhon? What's a CORE?
Great question. [Pyrrhon](/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) is CORE's dictator and scientist. Creator of clones.
What's a [CORE](/Bits/Worldbuilding/CORE.md)? It's like your heart. Your soul inside of a machine. You need other people's COREs to survive. 
Not everyone has a CORE, it's mostly for soldiers. But to survive, they devour and consume other CORE's.
# What a lame name! 
Wanna see more? Here's my characters! (The playable ones)

### LORE
[Prequel](/Bits/Story/Prequel.md)
[Cloning](/Bits/Worldbuilding/Cloning.md)
[Stickfigures](/Bits/Worldbuilding/Stickfigures.md)
[General Worldbuilding](/Bits/Worldbuilding/General Worldbuilding.md)

## Wait, where’s the story?!
Sweats. Well, it’s existed, just not in a good draft. Core’s main story is currently on its ninth draft (with  more to come!) A good way to read up on the story is probably..
[Prequel](/Bits/Story/Prequel.md)
Theres two ways you can diverge from here.

- *FOR MORE ABOUT TLH, SHENX, AND KHAN..* (optional reading, but useful if youre a particularly large fan of [Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md).
[Shenx](/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md)
[TLH](/Locations/TLH.md)
- *FOR MORE/ ABOUT MARIAN AND THE MAIN STORY..*
[Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)

Then,
[Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) (if you havent read about tlh and shenx, now is the time to do that.)
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) 
[SCRAPKILL](/Bits/Story/SCRAPKILL.md) (Honeycakes centric)

Now what?
If that bores you, then you can click on a random character and pray it has a finished description. Like [Coda](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Coda.md) or [07 ANGEL](/Characters/Bosses/07 ANGEL.md). 


## Locations
*”Wait, why are some locations in a completely different format?”*
I wrote them a very long time ago when CORE was in its initial drafts.
