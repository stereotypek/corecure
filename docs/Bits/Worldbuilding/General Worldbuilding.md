## Hackinf
Ahh.. [Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md)'s favorite (lie) pastime.
***Netrunning -----***
Since a lot of netrunning is done via personal hardware embedded in the person, constantine and many others employ Zombies to do their dirty work

So that things can't be traced back to them, they can buy zombies. These are people who have died but aren't officially registered as dead. This includes clones (safest) to real life people. It is a highly illegal market as I'm sure you can imagine.
These are basically like virtual machines but for personal machinery. Obviously people use PCs and Laptops but this is for doing more advanced hacks. Laptops can only do so much in the CORE world..
You can technically use a real alive person as a zombie but they're going to die once it's inevitably traced back. being zombified is like a death sentence.
Some particularly notorious folks rent out zombie servers (warehouses with cooled corpses). You can temporarily rent a zombie. It's good because if you're doing it for an individual project and you don't want to buy a whole zombie + do maintenance this is good. 
You can also rent out full zombie warehouses and servers for advanced DDOSs. As you can also imagine the servers are raided frequently, so they are entirely remotely hosted. They are built with bombs in the zombies and also in the hardware so there's many reports of people accidentally wandering into a server warehouse and dying because the place self destructs basically.

## General
I like to imagine that some independent fishers go out paddle boarding to save on power and electricity. Also because they cant afford boats. [Honeycakes](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) does this with a lot of her days, but a lot of the fishing areas are mostly filled with oil.. luckily for her, that means the fish float near the surface so she’s able to stab them. Shes a great paddler, she just doesnt like water bc she weighs like 2 tons (kidding). 
I also like to headcanon that [Honeycakes](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is so heavy, that when she sits down on a chair, she doesnt actually sit down or she’d break it. She does an electric chair squat instead.


### Refined vs Unrefined Magic
**Unrefined** magic is the act of generating magic from the environment and the body, drawing from emotions and internal and external energy. While it can be limitless, it's very taxing. It's much more powerful and can be indestructible under the right circumstances, but you die early. 
thags a lie. *Pyrrhon spread that as a lie (she killed the unrefined mg users bc they were a threat) and shifted public opinion to use refined magic instead. Padme is one more unrefined magic user.*
**Refined** magic is basically what everyone under the age of 200 uses-- magic that's less taxing to the body. Instead of creating magic from nowhere and doing shit with it, it must be channeled through a magic transmuting object ( sword, a book, hammer, etc) and exerted through electricity )from the obj$ and also the user. Much less powerful, but easier to control and learn.
To assist with refined magic sometimes people get crystal tattoos (nea has one on her forehead, shenx on his neck, etc) to help regulate internal magic flow + mark refined magic.
However most people get that tattoo without refined magic and it's more of a fashion statement now.

## Currency 
***Danari*** ——
Ummm Danari is the equivalent of Cash in CORE. It’s untraceable and rare.
It’s also kind of like BTC in the fact that it’s mostly used for underground transactions and it highly sought after.

There’s digital transactions but that’s controlled and monitored by Pyrrhon so underground folks made Danari. There are physical ATMs who have an “overworld” (main city) business and an “underground” business. They’re all merchants so that they can get profits and not get suspicious since Pyrrhon can still monitor what they sell. The process is like

The ATM proxy takes the currency from the person
It is put into a machine that places the currency data into a machine, which spits out the data into physical forms
Danari is printed. Each one has 5, 10, 50,or 100 currency worth of digital money.

The ATM does NOT RECIEVE THE MONEY. IT IS PUT INTO PHYSICAL FORM. It is just a proxy. However they do take a cut of hte profit as a tax.
Since the money is being ‘output’ when it’s put into the machine, it is registered as a product being sold (like Plushes, keychains, clothes, etc). Which is why it needs to be 

## Politics
Fun fact, Pyrrhon is immortal. And the general public isn't aware!

Due to a treaty it IS a democracy, BUT the other applicants are either pyrrhons' pawns or other clones. They have different campaigns and beliefs but in the end, no one gets into power. Pyrrhon just stays there.

## Fashion 
Baggy clothes. A lot of ppl like Constantine and Coda wear baggy clothes. It was popularized by this old guy who was kind of like a.. weird meme joke guy? Imagine bob Ross but he was high all the time. It’s kinda like how Reddit views Keanu reeves.

Hair side parts. You know how Honey has her little strand of hair on the side? That was popularized by a dancer/pop singer. It was culturally appropriate to keep your hair upright and neat at all times. So this girlboss went to go preform for Pyrrhon, and as kind of a silent revolt she made her hair really messy and weird, and the side part was the most prominent part of it, so it caught on in pop culture. 

Magic Tats. You know the star that Nea has on her forehead? It’s a religious thing but also a lot of punks like to DIY it because it looks cool. They basically just embed a crystal into their skin.

Excessively long hair
Symbolizes longevity and basically how long you’ve lived and that you are wise nad have experience

Crazy amount of piercings
The same thing as long hair but for cucks

Phantom of the opera mask with a flower blooming out of it
Caused from a scene from a popular video game. People loved it so much that it became a genuine trend among the fans and, eventually, among everyone else.

## Nature
Since natural grass fields are so rare, it's actually a souvenir business. People have large plots of land where "original grass" was preserved, and People pay to frolick in the fields a little bit.
Its really popular for a lot of people! 
The highest class are able to visit gardens since it's so rare to have real plants. 
It's mostly been replaced? They use this weird tree replacement that's like a tank full of strange liquid that has holes in the top to expel oxygen. The remaining carbon dioxide? Don't worry about it..
Cacti are the most popular plant bc of how .. well they survive, anything? So a lot of outdoor shops hang out cacti. It's kind of "a sign of authenticity" for them

Most of the ground consists of metal plates and various supports, which were then coated with concrete and then built upon. So when Gamma and Honey touch real, non-sheeted ground, they have a difficult time adjusting.
The reason this was done was because some areas had disease and were completely uninhabitable, so they just built over it

## Cyborg and Robot culture
There are "cold springs" for cyborgs to go to when they need to cool down. The pools are mineral oil or an alternative. There are also advanced ice baths, and spas for them to go to when they're overheating.
There are cyborg specific offices as well which are kept very cold.
"cold springs" Are quite common and are also used as libraries and capsule hotels if you're lucky

## Societal Norms
Sex is kind of frowned upon in higher class society so 80% of pregnancies are done through painful surgeries. it is also to encourage more genetically modified/tampered birth.
