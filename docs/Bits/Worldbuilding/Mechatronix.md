CORE’s a platform hack-n-slasher with stick figures. 
## Characters
**Each character has 9 attacks:** 
4 normal attacks:
> 	`mid-air`
> 	`Up`
> 	`Down`
> 	`L/R`

4 magic attacks 
> 	`up` 
> 	`Down`
> 	`L/R` 
> 	`Special | Shift`

… and 1 Ultimate


**A ‘special’ (or a ‘Shift’) is basically like a characters ‘secondary mode’. For example..**

Gamma
> `uses her fists to fight using hand-to-hand combat. Using her ‘shift’ will make her stationary, but she will be able to used ranged attacks with her gun.`

Constantine
> `normally uses an extremely large and heavy gun when he moves to attack people from a very long range. When he uses his ‘shift’, his attacks become less stationary but much weaker.`

Honeycakes
>  `normally uses a large obnoxious hammer which is also extremely slow. Surprisingly, she’s faster than Constantine. Using her ‘shift’ will change her attacks to be slower, but charged with magic and deal more damage and hits per second.`

Nea
>  `uses a sword to fight with people, but upon using her ‘shift’, she will shoot extra projectiles (sparks) with her sword, and a few of her attacks will be completely changed. (Ie her up attack will launch a projectile Instead of swinging upwards)`

## SHIFT
continued. There's a 3 second cooldown between each switch.
Also, when in shift state, you gain **HEAT**. When too much heat is gained, you begin to overheat and your accuracy is tanked and your speed decreases.
Maximum stack of heat before stunning is 10.
If you reach max heat, you snap out of it and are stunned for 5 seconds.

When playing the game, you’re given four total lives. You can distribute these Among all four of your teammates. (Ie 1 life for each, 2 lives for one and 2 lives for the other, 4 lives for one, etc).
You can ‘tag in’ your other teammates mid-game unless you are in a cooldown period, stunned, in the air, etc. 

## Abilities
Signature ability
> `what the character is known for; a passive ability. For example, Honeycakes takes no hitstuns to any attack that deals less than 10% of her max HP (extended to 20% while in SHIFT.`

Extended Ability.
>`a “smart” reference to chord extensions. This is a characters secondary ability, which is less passive. This is activated in combat or by actions. For example, If Nea is hit mid-swing by a PHYSICAL attack, then trigger a parry slash. Also, gain the ability to cancel an enemy attack once every 5 seconds.`

Base: 
>`the characters base fighting moves. Their default four moves. The nail slash in hollow knight. You know?

SHIFT
>`refer above`

ULTIMATE
>`i’m not done yet`


## Death 
Your save point.. is a fridge. 
> 	`you can save an infinite amount of items inside of the fridge.` 
> 	`After you get a game over, you wake back up at the last fridge you saved at. You snap back out, like your death was nothing but a ‘bad dream’.`

However, each item that you took with you remains at your death point. Your memory will linger in the place that you last died. 
> 	`Failure to retrieve your ‘memory’ will result in all of your items and 70% of your cash being lost! (Cash of what you had on hand)`

# The World

The game is supposed to be this open world. and you’re supposed to be able to go through towns AND dungeons at the same time. Think of a metroidvania, but less ‘well done’. 
> 	`This is because metroidvanias are non-linear and emphasize exploration through multiple routes. While CORE has a FEW of those elements, it is an ultimately linear story.`
