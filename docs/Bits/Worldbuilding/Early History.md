The Human race has gone extinct.

From greed came war, and from war came disease.

Plants and Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body.

The only things left were the Rumors which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures.

They’d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought.

In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End.

The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens.

The rapture had begun.

Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it’s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped.

> 	`As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton. The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God. It’s the ultimate mothers womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it.`

> 	`There was a small girl inside of it.`

>     `Her name was Kei.`

The last living ruler of Beau’s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger.

A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis.

That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon’s Golden Rule.

She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch.

Everything seemed fine.

And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant.

> 

> 	`Everything has since been stuffed under the rug.`  

> 	`With each disease cured, came millions of dead bodies.`

> 	`With each city liberated, came another pointless regulation.`

>     `Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug.`  

>     `To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too.`  

With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning.

Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously young, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been.

With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person.

Pyrrhon.

From her goal of reversing Beau’s tyranny, she had become even worse.

It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous ‘clone army’.

This marked the years until now as “The Age of Eugenics”, because that’s what it was and still is.

And everything’s crumbling, all the same.

Will another leader repeat the cycle, or will the Earth crumble into its long awaited demise?
