A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There’s a rumor that [Pyrrhon](../../Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) injured God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. 

A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it?

It's something which wraps around your heart and becomes your heart. Your core is your physical strength. It eats away at your life energy and future strength to give you superhuman abilities now, with a very shortened lifespan. The longest national guardian to live was 43.

A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action.

Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN’s whole lifetime can’t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful.

You level up your CORE using other’s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it’s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth.

You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE’s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it.

The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist.

**Unironically, Power Creep is a real issue in CORE.** 
It’s essentially:

>someone dies

>take their CORE

>Obtain a portion of their power

>that person dies

>take their CORE

>Obtain a portion of their power

>that person dies

>take their CORE

>Obtain a portion of their power

And so on.
