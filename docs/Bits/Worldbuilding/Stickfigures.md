Incredibly outdated.

- Stickfigures are an amalgamation of flesh which evolved from RUMORS (ref WFN)
        - since they were ‘created’ after the world had far long ended, they had to fend for themselves and evolved into a primarily fighting-type species.
            - Being evolved from a species which has long followed humans since the creation, they have evolved into semi-humanoids but not entirely human. They do refer to themselves as _human_, though.
    - Stickfigures, or Sticks, all come with the unique ability to harness magic (the very magic which killed the human race, they’ve built resilliance over time) and are extremely durable. They recover easily, they’re _made_to fight.
        - Those who posess physical disabilities to fight, however, work in other jobs like office work. It’s more common than you might think, especially now.
            - They are all generally pretty nice to those with disabilities. They don’t call it a _disability_, it’s more of a “trait”.
                - “Your trait is the role of a healer, fascinating!” “Wow, you’re practically made for this! (receptionist)”.
                    - some stickfigures with asthma have to have a permanent bubble around them. Conviniently, there’s a company which develops these at birth. They can go through it, it’s semi-permeable, like a cell membrane, and it’s developed with that persons umbilical cord.
    - Skin color changes based on environment. Colder colors are more common in cooler environments and warm.. you know.
        - Hotter environments turn your skin into a more black/greyer tone than before, while cooler ones simply pale it down. Humidity gives you more depth while dryness just makes you super pale.
            - skin color traits are incomplete dominant genes. However codominance does happen, but very rarely,
