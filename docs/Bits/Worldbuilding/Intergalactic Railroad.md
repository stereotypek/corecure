OUTDATED 

- Contrary to its name, it is not intergalactic.
- IGR is a small railway which travels over No Man’s Land and into 1 of the four living areas. Each train station includes:
- A chain bar system called the “Slaughterhouse”, but it works more like a pub.
- An inn system
- A small, underground meditation chamber for religious folk
- This is a game mechanic
- A temporary waiting room
- 2-3 shops.
- Quality doesn’t vary, but each living space has 2 systems. There’s a general one, and then there’s one in the inner circle (the other one has been overtaken by the Underground!)
- The one in the underground is still usable! Just.. be careful, okay?
- They do not go to the outskirts, but it’s easy to get there via tram/trolley or walking. It’s conveniently placed like, right in the middle of two layers
