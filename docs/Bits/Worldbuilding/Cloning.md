# The Prodigal CORE

Also known as *The Mother Womb*

When God fell into [Pyrrhon](../../Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)’s hands, it was this incomprehensible green mass, which held no particular shape or form. It did not stick to her hands, but contained a sort of semi-permeable membrane, which would accept living objects inside of it to consume for energy. After all, it had [Kei](../../Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Kei.md) inside of it, acting as her ‘cocoon’. 

As she began to study it, she realized that it was completely self-sustainable in energy and could almost never run out, and constantly regenerate itself with no punishment whatsoever. It was like a large mass of dead cells, which still had life within itself (in the membrane— outside of the membrane it would die instantly).

It was the perfect breeding ground for cloning. Using the ‘chopstick method’, [Pyrrhon](../../Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) was able to clone her first animal— a sheep. Her name was Tres Leches, which was her favorite dessert.

Tres Leches died. As most cloned animals do. And cloning wasn’t Pyrrhon’s priority until it was.

as time went on, and Pyrrhon developed more political stability and less mental stability, she began her old passion project of cloning. She went out to find the most absolute most genetically perfect people (which didn’t include herself, but she donated her own cells anyway since they were very readily available), and cloned them in mass batches using factories and automated machinery and AI to further perfect the chopstick method. However she discovered the actual backstory to that terminology so she changed it to be the ‘metal chopsticks method’ (how original…)

She did succeed! Pyrrhon’s first successful creation was the initial batch of Pi-Bots, which she raised like her own daughters. The youngest died at age 6 and the oldest died at age 12. They all have a natural garden as their graveyard which is very carefully attended to.

Over time, she got more busy with politics and got [Huangzhi](../../Characters/Bosses/Huangzhi.md) to handle most of the cloning. He created [Prodigal](../../Characters/Bosses/Prodigal.md) all by himself, and the third generation clones (the ‘Greek’ era). Pyrrhon co-developed the other ones further, since the third generation had free will, and they wanted to shift to AI after the incident with [Omega](../../Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md).


# Process

1. Stem cells are cloned.

    1. Via the process of mitosis. The nucleus of one DNA cell is carefully extracted and placed into the cell membrane belonging to the prodigal core, a womb. It then preforms mitosis and multiplies.

2. Those stem cells start growing organs.

    1. there’s a lot of different kinds so they have lots of different stem cells developed. Nuclei for stomach, lungs, etc…

3. While the artificial organs are in development, a half-developed brain (sometimes AI, sometimes real brain) is placed with the organs, so that while development, the _nervous system_ will naturally connect.

    1. Okay so when you want to move your arm, you have neurons in your brain that activate the nerves that activate the movement. That is your nervous system. It’s hard to replicate, so it happens naturally. Nerves connect during development.

        1. SHOULD this method mutate or fail, you can always connect artificial wiring to connect neurons to the nerves, however it’s extremely complex and usually fails.

4. The life will occur naturally as the organism is developed.

5. The embryo is placed into a large testing tube, in which it grows around a metallic skeleton while it develops. They connect and it sticks together like a natural skeleton.

    1. Artificial muscle and such is added at this stage.

        1. The testing tube liquid is the prodigal core, which is an infinite source womb.

6. The body is constantly fed things like sugar and necessary energy ingredients. While it does have its own energy, it needs to feed off of something.

7. It grows into a body. The sentience of the brain has been numbed and shut down. They are feeding it information through [REDACTED] (lazy).

8. Clones awaken at one time, though one team is assigned to one clone. Usually only one clone of each batch survives.
