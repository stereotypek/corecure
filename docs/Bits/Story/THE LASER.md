When [Gamma](../../Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and [Nea](../../Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) defeated [Phi](../../Characters/NPCs/Other clones/Phi.md), she left behind a large, ancient, unregulated laser in the middle of the forest. While her [CORE](../Worldbuilding/CORE.md) does power it, it needs a lot more power..

The Laser is pointed directly at [Bits/Story/FUTURE](FUTURE.md), where all the clones are made. The end goal is to power up the laser and destroy [Bits/Story/FUTURE](FUTURE.md) to inhibit clone production and maybe kill [Pyrrhon](../../Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md). 

However, they need to kill other clones in order to use their [CORE](../Worldbuilding/CORE.md)s to power it.

for each ‘Greek god’ Defeated, you obtain a [CORE](../Worldbuilding/CORE.md) which will increase either base stats for everyone or will give a secondary ability/improve secondary abilities.

You have two already so there’s only like , 3 others that you need to get. Each of them is its own side story. For example,

Honeycakes is main story in [Hà-Binh](../../Locations/Hà-Binh.md)

Theta is in [Sosolensk](../../Locations/Sosolensk.md)

Phi is in whatever the city is

Muse is ()

Epsilon is ()

Etc.
