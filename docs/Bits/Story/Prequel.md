It’s a dingy night.

A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. 

Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes.

He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake.

The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn’t matter, none of it did.

Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes.

Marian signs away to the National Guardian— a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him.


Now, the process for becoming a National Guardian is quite complex, despite the growing need for their presence.
It all begins in the Colosseum, where all candidates are trained under a group of 6-8 people for three grueling weeks. They’re trained by rough military professionals, trained to stick together like troops and to fight. It’s genuinely so horrific that many of the soldiers drop out, or die from this. This is done to weed out the weaker ones. 

Marian is placed in a group with Pitaches, his leader. A grumpy old man with little to no regard for anyone but himself. And another boy, named Khan. And ten others.
Now, this group was Kind of like a band of misfits. The leftovers. The only two who survived the initial 12 was Khan and Marian. This is SIGNIFICANTLY less than most, with most troops ending at 4-6 people final. 

But that doesn’t matter. Yes, Khan and Marian hate each other. Yes, Khan thinks Marian is egotistical for his motivations. But ultimately, their shared hatred for Pithaches (pronounced Pith- ahh- keys) trumps their hatred for each other. 

so the final test in the [Colosseum](CΓÖíRE/Locations/Colosseum.md) is like a hunger games sort of thing and it’s played live for the public. It’s like their NFL. They end up coming in fourth place. 

Welcome to the national guardian association, group 24601!

Now, the real fun begins. Being a national guardian here is quite nice! Climb up the ranks, get sent on missions.. it’s like being a legal mercenary, but you don’t choose the shots— Pyrrhon does!
Marian, as time goes on, grows more passive. A bit more mature. less like that immature, fierce little boy he was before and more like a stoic, warmer figure. 
Khan, as time goes on, grows more aggressive. A bit more immature, less like that mature, stoic, and warmer child he was before. And more like an immature, fierce, hardcore guy.

They start to fight, obviously. They didn’t know what else to do. 

Marian, after a particularly rough mission, finds Pithaces dead in a ditch somewhere. 
He doesn’t tell Khan, just dragging Pithace’s corpse into a 6 foot hole and burying him silently. Without incense, without thanks or regrets. A sign was stabbed into the thick, crusted metal of the Earth which read “PITHACES” in the worst handwriting possible. Not that Marian knew how to write anyway, so it probably read something else.

Anyway. He and Khan go more separate into their opposite ways. 
Until one day, they’re sent on a mission with [Uche](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Uche.md) and [Padme](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Padme.md). 
Now, they were sent in particular to put down the ANGELS, a rouge AI which was taking over the dead corpses of clones in the mountains of Ngima (Reference [Hà-Binh](CΓÖíRE/Locations/Hà-Binh.md)). 

Now, Khan and Marian’s quarrels were so incredibly destructive that this was actually a suicide mission. They weren’t supposed to actually take out the angels. 
Uche and Padme are odd scenarios. Uche is a warrior, and Padme is a magician. Neither of them want to be there, but they’re attached at the hip. A packaged deal!

Uche and Padme are difficult to describe. But they’re like the bookman clan in D. Gray-Man. They’re spies, not meant to really do much. Uche and Padme are just the names that they’d chosen for this mission in particular. 

Anyway, against all odds, after many greuling months and almost a year, the angels are completely wiped out thanks to the four of them. They call themselves the ULTIMATE DREAM TEAM!! (Two exclamation marks included). 
Padme and Uche, despite how much fun they had, are whisked away for their next mission. History was recorded with the angels, they have no need to be with them.

Khan and Marian are lead to believe Uche and Padme died in combat right after. In reality, Uche and Padme live in the mountains together. They’ve been long retired, enjoying their lives. 

anyway Khan and Marian slowly begin to reconnect. About their shared hatred for Pithaces. 

On a particular night, tipsy and buzzed, they see a young girl being thrown out of an office building. Marian watches her with an odd curiosity. 

In short, he and Khan feel incredible pity for her and decide to help her get a job with the national guardian society. They find out that Chou has perfect genetics, and they whisk her away to be an egg donor.
Khan and Marian think they’ve done well and go out to drink and celebrate. 
Chou was condemned to death. 

> Chou is the mother of all of the clones. By the end of her days with the national guardian, she was horrifically mutated and missing an eye and both of her arms. 

She holds them in incredibly high regard though. For some odd reason.

Kei awakens at this time.

  **TW FOR RAPE** 
	Marian is suddenly called up to Pyrrhon’s lair.
	See, Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Not because of his looks or odd morals, but simply because Kei glanced in his vague direction one day. She saw it as a ‘prophecy’, from God himself.
	Now, Pyrrhon’s all powerful, and her obsession with Kei has caused her to slip, and she can do whatever she wants with him…
	“It doesn’t even have to be human,” says Pyrrhon. “It just has to be *you*.”
	That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates.


The bar is dingy, like the night that Marian sold his soul. Humid and dense, paint peeling off the walls. 
He talks with Khan. Not fight, *Talk*. Quite literally the first civil conversation Marian had had with another person in years. 
They talk about Pithaces. His death. Chou. Their experiences with Padme and Uche. Their other shared missions. 

It’s then that Marian begins to break down about 

…

So, now they’ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they’re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it’s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon’s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it’s not within Pyrrhon’s rules, it’s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. 

And so, Marian went on a mission (his last mission). He took her, Khan, and Chou with him to finish up the mission (Chou was there because she needed to be transported— Khan and Marian just so happened to run into her). The mission was to basically put down a rebellion/rebel group named “The Last Hope”. 

Marian slams his sword down. “I’m done with this,” he says. “I can’t do this anymore.” 

Khan can’t say much. 

He doesn’t have much to say. 

He gets it, but, “You’re going to leave us?” 

“I don’t have to,” says Marian. “You can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?” 

“But—“ 

“But what? We-we’ll cook together and live together, and Chou’ll be fine, and Pyrrhon’s gonna leave us alone, and..” 

“…” 

“…” 

“Stupid, isn’t it? That’s what you always say. But, just listen to me! Just this once! It’ll happen!..”

 “I—..” 

“..,” 

“I can’t leave, Marian.” 

“…” 

“But I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.” Khan wraps his scarf around Marian’s neck. “I’ll miss you, Marian.” 

Marian smiles wistfully. “I hope to see you again.” 

(They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. 

Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history.  Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl.  He’s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). 

…

A particular ten year old brat drowning in his own blood and vomit stirs amongst the rubble.

…

Marian remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child.

**TW FOR RAPE** 
#### In short, Marian and Pyrrhon are NOT ideal. This is, in fact, the least ideal situation possible. 

> “It doesn’t even have to be human,” says Pyrrhon. “It just has to be *you*.”

Pyrrhon. She fully believes that what she’s doing is right. She doesn’t register Marian’s age or consent as an issue, rewriting reality to fit her needs. 
“Our new beginning,” she said. “Your body, your blood.. it will outlast *all* of us. Isn’t that beautiful? To think, that *you* will be a part in this?”
Marian has no power to say no. 
He does attempt to resist, thrashing out of the grip of the metallic arms. But no use, he’s injected with a tranquilizer straight to the neck. The next thing he knows, he wakes up to a clone of Pyrrhon riding him. 
he yells, *something*. But he can’t even understand his own words at that point.
It’s 
Awful. 
It doesn’t feel good. But it feels oddly heavenly. sending chills up his spine and makes his guts coil together. He feels sick. He wants to throw up but he’s simply too weak. His eyes roll back into his head. It isn’t even pleasurable, he can’t *feel* it in the first place. Drool trickles down his cheek, eyes half-glazed over as he gazes into the eyes of THE CLONE. 
As if letting go of the last shreds of his life, 
He lets the seeds of the dandelion fly off and flutter into the wind. 
Marian’s vision goes black again. 

Anyway, Marian is kinda let out of Pyrrhon’s lair traumatized and unable to speak. He goes to a bar with Khan. He sobs, no one will believe him. And those who did, said he should be grateful for it. 
Khan believed him though. 

> Khan and Marian both stop by a bar and kinda go over what’s happened to them so far. How far they’ve come. How they’re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. 

his relationship with Khan turned into some odd, homoerotic relationship. Where Khan feels bad for everything he did to Marian. And Marian is fucking the shit out of Khan just to feel something, *anything*. Khan doesn’t know if he consents to it, but Khan just knows he’s part of the reason why this happened to Marian in the first place. He needs to help Marian. After all, Marian is his best friend, right? 
Marian feels nothing afterward. 
Not shame, nor pleasure. 
Just the feeling of his release churning into Khan. 
And Khan, 
he *wants* to help, yes. But he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to say no without abandoning Marian. It’s not sex, like a dance. It’s like a mechanical ritual. With no pleasure involved, except for the churning of organs and the creaking of joints and the bed beneath them.

### Shenx
> A particular ten year old brat drowning in his own blood and vomit stirs amongst the rubble.

Shenx. His parents were DEEPLY involved in [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md), and so was he. He was a fierce warrior even at like. Age ten. So of course he fought with them!
[CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) was kind of giving up (this is the night he left with [Nea](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)) and [Khan](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md) was super pissed off about it so he took his anger out on [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md).
[Khan](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md) saw Shenx and was in such a hurry to just slaughter everyone, he just sliced off Shenx's legs assuming he'd already died /would die of blood loss.
Shenx did not die
So his whole mission is fueled by revenge to kill [Khan](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md), and consequently [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)'s empire. He built his mech out of the remains of what was left in [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md) and the dead clones that his parents killed. And went to the underground..
People generally respected this 12 year old boy walking in with no legs and a mech doing all sorts of crazy shit. He met lots of good friends (one in particular named Sho) and managed to scrape together enough money and people to revive [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md). It's an underground operation still, but they do operate.
Tl;dr shenx is mad at [Khan](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md) for cutting his legs off, revives a rebellion group out of spite
