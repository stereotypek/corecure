[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md) [Dinh](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md), [Adam](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Adam.md), and [Kit](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Kit.md)’s resistance group.


[Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) is a scientist.
Like most scientists, she creates experiments. 
To test emotional intelligence and bonding under artificial stress. [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)’s theory: “If we can make even broken clones function as a unit, we can make _anyone_ loyal.”
The Scrapcore unit—[Dinh](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md), [Adam](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Adam.md), [Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md), and [Kit](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Kit.md)—were dropped into a controlled “wasteland” sim zone.
Fake urban ruins. No food, minimal gear.
 Monitored 24/7. Neural data streamed into [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)’s labs.
No win condition.
The test was meant to collapse after 30 days, with behavioral breakdowns studied for refinement.
Begin.
INSERT STUFF HERE they get out.

> The camera feeds fuzzed. [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) marked them as “LOST ASSETS.” 
> But she was still watching.

In the forgotten sector, surrounded by discarded tech, malfunctioning AIs, and broken clone pods, the four made a base. It wasn’t supposed to happen. The system didn’t know what to do with them.

- They became something of an urban legend among failed clones: a ghost team. Unstable but free.
	- They weren’t a rebellion, at least not in Pyrrhon’s eyes. They were a malfunction. She saw [Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md)’s rebellion not as failure, but as defiance. *Personal* betrayal. So she took it _personally_.
- [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) decided to test her new weapon: a miniaturized, precision-targeted doomsday laser, a condensed nuke, designed to melt cities from orbit. Testing it on [Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md) was the perfect test.
> [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) grinned. “Let’s see what hope looks like under 8 trillion kelvin.”

[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md) was locked in a containment chamber—torture-level clean, clinical, and pressurized. As most laboratories are.
And the laser fires up.
Omega looks at [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md).
[Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) only smiles. 
the machine whirs in the back, heat gurgling from its engine and seeping out into the tip, ready to—!

[Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) sat with her torso scratched from falling debris.
Blood trickled down onto the floor.
Her first injury this century.

[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md), carried in the arms of [Dinh](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md), went into an escape pod.

But [Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md) looked back at the moment of the laser’s first test-firing. Even just one glance at the beam’s ignition—through transparent shielding—was enough to permanently destroy his eyesight. Retinas flash-boiled. Optic nerves scorched. A scream cut short by shock.
…
> A biotech-enhanced spatial sensor was surgically implanted in her skull. It translates physical surroundings into a 3D representation in her brain—like a sonar map + LIDAR system. It’s “sight,” but not the same. No colors. No light. Only shapes, distance, motion, and pressure. He can, in fact, *see*, but everything looks like a haunting, low-poly wireframe world.
> No longer he be able to gaze into the eyes of
> …
> Were they his friends in the first place?

They’re on Earth. Now what? 
[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md): “We need a chain of command. We do what I say or we die.”
[Dinh](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): “We don’t need a leader. We need a plan. You’re not it.”
[Adam](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Adam.md): ”You act like we even have a chance.” 
[Kit](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Kit.md): “…”

Fight here

[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md):  
We need structure. A schedule. A command hierarchy. Or we’re not making it to next week.

[Dinh](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md):
Structure got us blinded.

OMEGA:
Say that louder. Go on.

Dinh:  
You wanna lead 'coz you can't stand silence.

OMEGA:  
I want to lead because I’m the only one who ever *has*.

[Adam](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Adam.md): 
Pfft. That why you walked us into a laser? Real leadership right there.

OMEGA:
*I* got us out. *I* bled for this team. You think hiding and biting walls makes you better?

ADAM (absolutely not taking this shit seriously, grinning):  
You think yelling louder makes you smarter? Face it, meathead, you’re half blind and full of shit.

[Kit](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Kit.md) (in a corner, whispering to her dolls):  
don’t fight don’t fight don’t fight don’t—

OMEGA:  
And you, Dinh—what, you’re in charge now? ‘Cause you scowl better?

Dinh:  
At least I don’t bark orders like a wounded dog.

OMEGA:  
You really think you can handle leadership?

Dinh:  
I can handle you.

ADAM:  
Oooooh. Mom and dad are fighting.

OMEGA:  
Shut it, Adam.

ADAM:  
Make me.

(Fight) 

Dinh slams Omega against the wall with a dagger to his throat

OMEGA:  
You wanna kill me too now? Go on. Do it. Just admit it.

Dinh:  
You killed yourself the moment you made it all about you.

KIT:  
Crying. Something’s crying something’s wrong wrong wrong really wrong crying crying I hate fighting I hate fighting I hate fighting something’s something’s something’s 

A doll leaps out of her lap and begins to speak, "Do it. Just admit it. Do it. Just admit it. Do—"

Omega grabs the doll and crushes it in one hand.

OMEGA: 
STOP.

ADAM: 
Don’t you fucking TALK TO HER LIKE THAT—!

Dinh:  
ENOUGH!

Everyone freezes. Breathing hard. Blood on the walls. Dolls twitching. Omega’s vision flickers, sensors sparking.

OMEGA:  
You’ll die without me.

ADAM:  
Then we die.

Dinh:  
Better than living under your ego.

KIT:
It’s warm. It’s warm. Something’s not right. Something’s not right. Not right. No no no no no no no no not anymore not right anymore 

(OMEGA LEAVES) 

ADAM spits on the ground:  
One less mouth.

Dinh:  
One more ghost.

KIT picks up the broken doll and falls asleep.
