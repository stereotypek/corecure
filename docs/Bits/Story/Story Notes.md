- Theta

To obtain the better engine you need to get the core that Theta is guarding. The CORE was embedded into a living being made by Huangzhi and Theta together.
Comakin and Xinakin were originally one being but due to some errors they had split into two different people. They are the CORE and in order to get it, they have to be killed. Comakin knows he’s going to die since Xinakin is going to try to devour his half of the CORE to go back to being one single person.
it’s either Gamma, Nea, Constantine, and Honeycakes (and I guess shenx) kill them, or Huangzhi and Theta do it. 
Comakin has unkind things to say bout Gamma and Honey because theyre a clones. However he’s okay with Shenx and Constantine.
Actually Huangzhi manages to kill Xinakin and take out her CORE, but Constantine manages to take it back. He charges it using Theta’s CORE actaually so they dont need to kill Comakin. Comakin lives with Shenx until he dies, basically. Shenx took him in to work as a bartender.
When Comakin escaped, he was taken in by Moniqua and . Um the other people who live there. The village chiefs. 
Comakin knows where Khan lives which is how he got into a business relationship with Shenx in the first place.
Xinakin is a pretty passive presence. 
Comakin doesn’t like Prodigal or 07 Angel because they ran a siege on their town for supplies. And he really wasn’t the biggest fan.
He is online friends with Miyo. 
Fun fact, when you finish the ship, Comakin declines to go with you . He says he’d rather spend the rest of his life down here instead of going up in the air. He wants to live his life, and he knows that if he gets on that ship he will die a lot quicker.
