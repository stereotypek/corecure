—

Gamma needs to find his brother and Shenx to get their data off the air. 

S: Gamma! Pleasure to have you back in our ranks. It’s been a while.

G: Hi Shenx. I needed, uh, I need—

(Shenx hands Gamma and Nea a pistol and two suits)

S: I need a bit of ‘cleaning up’ first. You’re in no position to deny me.

G: … 

N: … 

G: Alright. Give us a moment.

S: Make it quick.

(Changing room) 

N: Wh-what the fuck?! What’s going on? 

G: It’s really simple. When Shenx tells you to shoot, you shoot.

N: and If I don’t..?

G: Don’t worry. It’s one of the running politicians in Ngima. You won’t miss him

N: What?!

G: You’ll get the hang of it. Or, what, you’ve never fired a gun before?

N: Tch. 

G: Hah. Alright, get up. 

 The politician will be assigned the variable “P”

S: I have proof that you were involved in the creation of Mutilation, and Prodigal. And involved in the, ah, forgive me.. *mutilation* of them both.

G: …

N: …? Gamma?

P: Wh-what..? 

S: You see it here, don’t you? Or are you blind? By this point I thought you’d have enough money to afford implants. Or are you too busy using it on those little girls? 

P: are you *blackmailing* me?!

S: Here’s the deal. You’re going to give us the information of the generation 2 clone genealogy, or we shoot you.

(Gamma and the other guards click their guns. Nea joins after a moment). 

P: H-hah, you won’t be able to get my implants! I’ll need to be alive.

S: Ah, don’t worry. I’m sure one of *them* would suffice.

(Video recording shows his wife and child) 

P: so that’s why they were here..

P: You wouldn’t kill a child and a mother, would you?

S: You wouldn’t want to be responsible for their deaths, would you? Hand it over.

P: …

P: Take it.

S: just what I like to hear. 

(Shard ejected) 

(Instantly after, Shenx gives a signal to shoot the politician. Nea, Gamma, and the others have to shoot the other body guards)

 you need to manually shoot the guard in a time limited event. If you miss the shot, then Gamma will shoot them for you. However Shenx and Gamma will grimace. Try not to make yourself look like a fool.. wouldn’t want them to think you’re a little princess, would ya?

(The video recording shows the mother and child also being shot)

N: (Nea has a choice here to say, “You killed him!” Or say nothing)

whatever Nea says here, not much will happen. If Nea decides to speak, Gamma will stomp on Nea’s foot and glare at her. Shenx will glance over menacingly but say nothing.

(Shenx rolls himself out from the chair)

N: Y-your legs..!

S: Mm? Yes, I’m afraid it’s too late for me to get them mended. But, really, these mechanical ones work so much better. 

G: Constantine isn’t here? Why are you wheeling yourself?

S: Of course not. And that’s just what makes your brother so special to me.

S: If I die, The Last Hope doesn’t. Your brother does all the real work. Me? I just put on a pretty face for the customers. 

G: Tch. 

S: Don’t you ‘tch’ me. Now, you need a job? I believe Rita has an assassinating she needs done.

G: I need a job from *you*.

S: …

S: Clean this up first. We’ll talk then.

(Wheels away) 

G: well? You heard him. Let’s get to work.

N: Are you sure this will work?

G: we’ve been friends since me and Const moved here. He can’t deny me.

G: I.. also can’t deny him

G: So let’s get working!

N: Right.

(Situation explained)

S: I see. 

S: (click clack) 

S: it’s off.

G: Huh? Where’s Constantine?!

S: …

G: Where is my brother!? Tell me, Shenx!! 

S: Quiet down.

G: ;;; 

S: *Your* data is gone, Gamma. Your friend.. well, she’ll need to be in our contract.

(Shenx slides over a contract) 

S: By signing this, you become a mercenary under my control.

S: Not like you have much of a say in this situation, anyway. 

(Nea hesitates, but signs it)  

(Shenx smiles) 

S: and there goes your records as well.

G: Why did they get on there in the first place?! Don’t you know how much danger this is gonna put us in?!

S: *my* records were there. Everyone’s records were there.

G: what?!

G: You’re telling me you have a security flaw?!

S: Quiet down. We checked, but..

S: it’s not a normal hacker. It’s an AI. 

S: Your brother is hunting it down right now. The server it’s located in, at least.

G: You’re letting that SICKLY little BASTARD HUNT DOWN AN ENEMY OF THE PUBLIC???

S: You can go look for him if you’d like.

G: Nea! We’re going!

N: uh?! (Spaced out) 

S: Just what I like to hear!~ please buy me one of Regina’s mango smoothies when you get back!

(They leave)


So anyway the thing that blackmailed them was one of [Pyrrhon](../../Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)’s AIs. It was this old thing that stored records for her back when she was still creating gen3 clones and it was basically used as an archiver. 

However Pyrrhon lost the need to use it and destroyed it.

… not really, though, since it’s alive and actively leaking things onto the internet now.

The AI is a replica of Pyrrhon and so is initially built to eliminate all threats to humanity’s future. So here are the possible ways it can be defeated

1. Savior’s dilemma 

	- The AI is built to **eliminate all threats to humanity’s future**, but TLH forces it to **identify itself as a threat**

	- They expose a contradiction:  

	    **1. If the AI controls the laser, it has the power to destroy the world.**  

	    **2. If it has the power to destroy the world, it is the greatest risk to humanity.**  

	    **3. If it is a risk to humanity, it must eliminate itself.**

	- The AI, following its core directive, is forced into **an endless loop of trying to delete itself** while still trying to “fix” the future.

	- Eventually, the logical contradiction **locks up the AI’s processes completely**, freezing it into inaction before a final forced shutdown

2. Paradox bomb

	- TLH **inserts a corrupted data set** into the AI’s system that **contradicts its own history**. For example, the AI has **records of past events**, but they feed it **data that claims the exact opposite happened**.

	- The AI, relying on logical consistency, **tries to reconcile both realities**—but **cannot**. Unable to resolve which timeline is “true,” the AI **fragments into chaos**, creating an infinite processing loop that **overheats its system and destroys itself**

3. Schrödinger’s Shutdown

	- The AI is **wired into the laser**, but TLH **rigs a failsafe** that will randomly **either shut it down or let it live**—and the AI **knows this**.

	- However, **until the program executes, the AI cannot determine its own fate.** Since it **cannot predict the outcome**, it cannot take action without **risking its own destruction*

	- The AI spirals into **decision paralysis**, unable to interfere because **any choice could lead to its demise.**

	- It shuts itself down in a desperate attempt to "pause" reality and prevent the unknown.

”what’s the Laser?”

	*later on in the story, the MC’s discover a laser. It’s extremely powerful, and could easily wipe out FUTURE (where clones are produced). However, the various pieces to it are scattered across the world and protected by particularly dangerous clones (Ie [Phi](../../Characters/NPCs/Other clones/Phi.md), [Mutilation](../../Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md), [Honeycakes](../../Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), etc.) and so, that creates the gameplay. 
	
	the AI is there to tie the MCs together and to give them initial relations. Except for Honeycakes who appears at the very end. The AI leads them to the laser which is the real meat and potatoes of the game.


Chapter 1: DEMOlition reel

- cutscene through the city 
	- It’s a 3d animated cutscene that is like a drone shot that goes through buildings, above buildings, through people’s workplaces and such. 

	- Eventually, it hovers behind Nea, who gets into her apartment. Room 404.

	- Nea opens her computer up

		- Her room is kind of a mess. clothes strewn everywhere. Sheets on the floor. Vibrator on the bed. All sorts of things.

	- Her eyes scan the computer and the new email she received

		- Focus on the eyes here, you can see the reflection of the email vaguely in the first shot. 

		- Then, cut to the “actual email” which is just snippets of text like NEA and BOUNTY and (ins amount here) and APT.404.

	- Nea receives a notification on her phone

		- New bounty: NEA V. AHMAD: (ins amount) 

	- Banging at the door.


- Draft
    
    - The opener is no cutscene, but instead Nea running through the forest from the nearby fire from the temple. You can fight a few things, and it teaches you how. Upon completion, she stares at the temple.

    - It’s great, next scene is her working a 9-5 office job.

        - She gets FIRED!!!

            - Like a cut from the fucking burning fire looking at the temple, and then her hacking away at a computer

                - “… This is boring. I should get coffee later.”

                - You walk out of the office to go to the cafe and all her stuff is just fucking thrown at her while she gets a coffee.

                    - “Congrats! You’re fired.”

                    - “…….”

                    - “…….”

                    - “…….”

                    - “……”

                    - “…. Thanks.”

                    - “No this is serious we did a background check and we found that you—“

                    - (Nea runs out)

                    - “—… were involved in a .. major historical fire, and…”

                    - “… she’s gone! After her!”

            - This is the tutorial sequence that you can die from, in an office building. Nea eventually jumps out of the window and lands on a car. It swerves and throws her into a nearby alleyway.

            - Nea gets up and wipes the mud off of her.

    - Here, she meets a pi-bot who was alerted. This is because she literally landed on its car.

    - You also crushed her head in, so.. just take her CORE.

    - You are given a perma core and instructed to go out to the forest.

        - _at this time, you can explore more of the caves. This is the first area, congrats! The city is closed off because there are guards looking for a ‘runaway worker’. Wonder who that is!_

        - _It is also the afternoon, and things will be different in the nighttime. They tell you to defeat enemies (plants) to be able to survive the night._

    - It’s nighttime. A lever opens for a room near the entrance.

    - When you enter, You see a blue Stickfig who appeared behind you.

    - _This is Gamma! She tosses her cig on the ground and activates her weapons._

        - Insert dialogue here. Secondary boss, that you’re healed from!

            - _So this is where you’re introduced to physical damage and magic damage. While Nea is much weaker to physical damage, Gamma is weak to magic damage. If only you could get a special move in…_

    - Gamma’s pride is hurt when you ‘defeat her’, so she just leaves.

        - There is a waterfall in the next room over. You can rest there. There is also a fridge where you can save LMFAO dont ask me why its there.
    
    The city is still being guarded so you have no choice but to find the NPC which gives you a small map, and defeat more enemies because its absurdly expensive. (Joke)
    
    You also don’t have to, you can also just go to the end of the map, where you spot Prodigal from a distance. You follow him.
    
    - From there, you see Gamma.

        - She’s laying on the ground with a power bank in her hands. You can pick it up, and also pick her up too.
    
    When you take it, something rumbles in the distance.
    
    - a bomb is thrown— PRODIGAL!!

        - Gamma shoots up. She suddenly collapses onto Nea. You ‘put her into your inventory’ LMFAOOGAHEHA

        - You run with Gamma out the forest (it’s just your normal sprite) and into the next area, where you flick a lever to stop her.
    
    shift to a small campfire that Gamma made. They talk for a bit.
    
    “Oh.. so you’re from the temples?
    
    I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!”
    
    _Gamma joins your party_. Also, the city is open again. You can go there when youre done exploring.
    
    Upon entering the city…
    
    - CTSCNE
        
        She spots a guy on the street.
        
        G “Nea, launch me.”
        
        N “Wh-what?!” G ”NEA, LAUNCH ME!”
        
        Nea launches her towards that guy. She tackles him to the ground. Nea’s about to sob her eyes out, but oh! That’s actually her little brother, Constantine.
        
        G “you little fucker! What’re you doin here?!?! Heheh!!
        
        C “Ga-Gamma..!”
        
        C “What the fuck?! I thought you were Prodigal!!”
        
        G “You didn’t tell me you moved here!! How’re ya doin, Const?”
        
        C “Terrible, now that you’re here.” G “Very funny Constantine. So, you’re still the engineer, right?” C “Uh oh, what is it this time?”
        
        Gamma holds the CORE up to Constantine. Nea finally catches up to them, gasping for air.
        
        Constantine’s eyes light up.
        
        C “I have an extra room.”
        
    - Constantine is like, “yeah one of you can take this CORE; it’ll power yours up and give you a temporary buff. I think Gamma doesn’t deserve it, so why don’t you take it, Nea?” (Gamma starts beating him up /j).
        
    - He says you can pay him back later with the Danari you collect from enemies.
        
    
    Starting guide:
    
    # **I want**
    
    - There’s this gang of animal-like people.

        - They’re actually trying to revive a dead religion and all believe that they are one with the spirits of their warrior ancestors.

        - They are not.

    - Gamma and Nea seek freedom

        - To disrupt Pyrrhon’s control, which seems impossible.

        - MAYBE go back to the video game plot; the one where Pyrrhon is self aware

    - They will do this by constructing the ULTIMATE CORE!

        - Using theft

        - Trading/bartering
    
    At first:
    
    - nea is fired whatergver
        
    - Brawl with Gamma
        
    - “Fuck you!” “Fuck you!”
        
    - Get lost in forest. “Oh it’s you”.
        
    - Gamma and Nea meet from a peace treaty.
        
        - Instead of Prodigal, they are initially followed by Commander Vee. He wants to kill both of them simply to raise his hierarchal status.

            - “What luck, that I’d find two beautiful girls, all trapped in here like this! Come now!”

                - Nea: this guy got me fired!

                - Gamma: this guy got me fired!

            - They run away and he’s really mad so he chases them around.

                - Now:

                    - Run around to get information and more gear

                    - Ok so they hide under the bar tables when Vee shows up to the slaughterhouse. They see how he threatens Shenx and brags about how he can leave this useless slum anytime he wants, and he has a home up there in the heavens.

                        - It’s fact checked by Gamma— he does! They now want to kill him to get that. However they have no fuckin idea where he is.

                            - This guy’s all bark no bite.. if we can get ahold of his stuff, we’d be rich beyond belief! We gotta kill this guy!

                            - “You might wanna talk to your brother, Gamma.”

                            - “H-huh?! How’d you—?!”

                            - “We’ve (shnx and const) been friends for decades. ‘Course I know who you are.”

                            - Nea: (Maybe this girl is useful. Hah).

                            - Constantine is over in (Baguio!)

    - Cue them being productive and encountering a few sidequests:
        
    - Eskalion’s attack patterns
        
        ATK one: Starts from one side of the stage, and runs at you at blinding speeds. It’ll damage you if you’re in the middle of it. He teleports and reappears above you and does one of two things A) he will shoot DIRECTLY BELOW HIM B) he will shoot to both corners of the room. Then he will disappear and reappear either grabbing at the walls or on the ground, preparing to fight again. If he’s on the wall, he will shoot in your general direction four times, teleport behind you, (he will linger so you can counter or move away), and swing. The swing is really big, but so is his cooldown. If he’s on the ground, he can:
        
        1. shoot at you with his gun

        2. jump up (From jumping up, he can either guard and reflect all bullets back at the player, OR he can throw a bomb. It basically goes in a straight line and can go as far as like, 25% of the room. So from the starting point (when he throws it) and when it ends, it bounces three times. Then, it’ll explode into large pillars which reach to the top of the room).

        3. lunge again
        
        At 25% health, he’ll crawl up to the top of the room, and swing around on a chandelier. He will shoot at you hysterically and you can’t deal any damage, so you just have to avoid it or guard. After that, he’s in a ravenous state and has increased speed, but lowered defense. His atk is much much higher thoughSo after this you probably get an introduction to Constantine and CORE buffs.
        
    - End
        
        Once he dies, I’ll initiate Prodigal/Balach’s arc, HORRAY! So upon death, he crawls over to the wall, while Gamma puts a gun in his head. He starts rambling incoherently about “God’s divine Will”, “revenge”, “the Goddess”, and other nonsensical religious bullshit. He then lets out a final plea of himself being a prophet or whatever, general religious psychosis talk. Then, he reaches out to the wall, and presses a big red button (which was once enclosed in a glass container).
        
        After that, the windows all shatter, and Prodigal jumps in. Vee starts talking to her and asks if she’s proud of him, but she just shoots him. Gamma and Nea are frozen in fear. Prodigal ignores them, and throws his limp body across the room, like a child playing with a toy. She then rips his head off and plays with his entrails. Yay! The screen blacks out and Prodigal is gone, Gamma and Nea both passed out. All that’s left is black goop and Vee’s gun, which you can take and use. Now, Gamma and Nea were trying to kill Vee so that they could get his ID shard, fake his identity, and rob him and the other corpos + get into restricted areas. However Prodigal broke it. Lmfao. Anyway the cops start to show up, so a cutscene plays where they just run out of the building.That’s the end of the chapter.
        
    - So there’s a huge explosion and Gamma and Nea are blown away. They both wake up seeing Honey, but they dont know who she is. She drops them on the ground, flicks over a business card, then leaves.
        
    - Cut to the Baguio place festival. Gamma is looking.
        
    - ok basically if you go to Prodigal, you go to the Akira collesum
        
        - It’s basically dogtown.

        - “Rumor has it, it’s completely outta Pyrrhon’s control. Being in No Man’s Land, an’ everything… bet ya haven’t heard of it, huh? Let me show ya ‘round.” ”excuse you! Everyone knows about this place.” “Yeah.. I’ve only heard rumors.” “It’s.. oddly quiet.” ”Yeah, no merchants jumping out, huh? Hah. Guess if yer here, you’re here coz ya know what you want. They don’t need to sell you nothin’. They got corpos an’ war criminals, all in one place.” ”Huh..” ”Heard you could get up to the space station if you had enough money.. well, you can get anything if you have enough money.” (Cue guy selling organs) ”… uh huh. So, who are we lookin’ for, again?” (Point). PREDEM II

1. FINAL DUNGEON
    
    _The lives we’ve left behind_
    
    _And whatever God is left for us._
    
    - “The factory’s been abandoned for some time now. But it started pumping out materials again!” “Huh? What _is_ the factory? Well, it was from the RAPTURE, it’s got some of Pyrrhon’s old radiators. If someone tries hard enough, they could make a bomb, but—..” “H-hey!! Where are you two rascals going?!”

    - “This is it,” Says Nea. “Let’s end this,” Says Gamma.

- Get in the side scroller mode for a period of time and hijack a ship entering from the factory.
    - Fight through it with the terrain changing due to the changes in altitude.

        - You play as Gamma first when they agree to split up. You go through a large wave of enemies and hit the button to stop the power flow, but the ship still goes. It’s up to Nea.

        - Cutscene of Nea running along the side of the ship and into Balach’s chamber. Follow him through a third wave in the storage cavity.

            - “HAHAHAH… Ah, you’re _pathetic,_ Nea!” “Just try to find me!”

                - you can’t actually find him. Break through the door and walk through it, and get pinned to the ground by Balach.

            - “Hah..!”

                - each line of dialogue takes off like, 10% of your remaining HP.

            - “Look at you! Pathetic!”

            - “YOU took EVERYTHING from me!”

            - “Hahhah.. hahah .. look at you,”

            - “WEAK!! YOU’RE WEAK, NEA!”

            - “That’s all you are. A fuckin mindless puppet of your father.”

            - “YOU’RE HIDEOUS!”

                - Balach kicks her. Nea’s HP falls to 0.

            - “Hah..”

            - “Futile, as always.”

            - “You didn’t even know my end goal with you.”

                - Balach flicks a switch which turns on a screen on top of every single school, temple, and family.

            - “You see, Nea?”

            - “Hahah. You didn’t even know.”

            - “Now, your CORE…”

            - “You’re the only one powerful enough besides myself.”

            - “Heheh..”

            - “Wait here, _whore_.”

        - Balach leaves.

        - Nea rolls over and regenerates one HP.

        - He walks in and nudges her with his foot.

            - “… You’re still awake?”

            - “I should’ve killed you, all those years ago.”

            - “You _and_ your father.”

            - “Hah.”

            - “Remember that day? You remember it well.”

            - “I did plan on Pyrrhon. What I didn’t plan on was his suicide. And _you_.”

            - “That CORE,”

                - He grabs Nea’s chest.

            - “That CORE is _mine_.”

            - “You don’t deserve it.”

            - “Give it up, Nea. Give it to me.”

                - Nea limply falls, but says one thing:

                    - “… You killed him?”

                - Balach doesn’t listen and takes out a knife.

                - Nea grabs it.

                    - “Dad..”

                    - “...”

                    - “My dad...”

- _Congrats to you and Nea for unlocking her secondary ULT!!~_
    - ULT: BLOOD DRIVE is now active!

        - Nea gathers all the blood seeped into the floor and revives herself with it. Whether enemy or stick, it’s hers now. She fights Balach again, who’s basically a dummy. He goes through the same cycle but you just deal infinitely more damage than he does. You chase after him and break all his shields until you pummel him into the ground, like the real ground, since youre in the sky.

            - The dust settles. He’s nothing but a CORE.

        - Nea looks around.

        - She’s right next to a body of water, and a mysteriously burnt pillar.

        - A nearby old and wet paper drifts in the wind.

    - _Versailles.._

    - Nea crushes Balach’s CORE,

    - And falls asleep.

- Gamma falls to the ground in a nearby parachute, picks Nea up, and walks home.

End of act one.

- From Now on
    
    Our primary goals after chapter One is character development and slower plot progression.
    
    - CHARA GOAL:

        - Focus on Gamma or Nea or Honey or Python

            - Choice, can be done in any order.

    - DRIVING FORCE

        - End goal: stop Pyrrhon.

        - Short term:

            - Grow Stronger

            - get PB CORE’s for story progression. Stars EQ

            - “There are five total maj chords we need in order to weaken Pyrrhon and nullify her core output. They’re here.”

            - After all that, they get the goal and have one final life-changing event, then leads into the finale.

Act 2: The Arena.

- I had a thought..
    
    _Now, CORE has a cool mechanic where you do not kill a single enemy. You knock them out. They will infinitely respawn once you take too long and until you reach the next area. You don’t_ have _to kill them, but you will get more rewards from the more you do._
    
    _‘Thou shalt not kill’ is a rule Nea and Gamma stand by, since they’re mostly fighting clones and Nea is obligated from religion._
    
    - It goes something like this.
        
        “It’s been two weeks since Balach’s death and Nea’s evolution.
        
        She’s still recovering from the magic overload.
        
        She’s fine, I guess.
        
        Since we’re alone, I’ll tell ya, I’m kinda jealous.
        
        I wish I could be as good as her.
        
        I wish I was useful.
        
        Goddamnit, look at the time!
        
        My food’s ready! See ya later!“
        
        ---
        
        CTSCNE
        
        - _Honeycakes_ swings a fish onto the table and begins to skin it. Chasmus takes the chopped pieces from earlier and pours it into a pot. Han takes a finished plate and carries it out.

            - From above, Prodigal and Lane snicker. Prodigal reaches down to take the plate. Han looks around, confused. Chasmus looks angry and Han looks back, sheepishly.

            - Prodigal hands the kebab to Lane, who eats it happily and giggles. They kick their feet off the roof and gaze off into the sky.

            - Camera shifts and fades into the upper left. Khan is sharpening his sword from atop a mountain. Python is starting a nearby fire out of old parts and notices the town. The fireworks explode.

        - Gamma and Nea walk through the town.

            - “Heheh! I told ya!”
                
            - “Whatever, sure! Heh. Ow!!”
                
            - “Oops, sorry.
                
            - I had this idea…
                
                Honey and Gamma become friends, almost immediately. It’s quick, like a gust of wind. They talk, inside the restaurant.
                
                - It’s a dog eat dog world out there, they both know.

                - Gamma says, “Dude, if I were rich, I’d go up into the stars.. You know, the interplanetary cities? We can live it up there. Hah! ‘s impossible though, we’re stuck down here.”

                - Honey, “It’s not as hard as you think. Networking’s mostly what it comes to.”

                - Honey pulls out a pouch from underneath the couch cushions.

                    - I have a CORE so unbelievably powerful, it could stop Pyrrhon in her tracks, easy.

                    - The power’s unregulated— one of her own. You could use this to get to the stars, easy. people would bow to you. You’d be at her level.

                    - However

                    - This CORE is not yet complete.

                    - This CORE is the project of fifteen groups of people, just like you.

                    - Hundreds of thousands.. I’ve lost count. There’s too many.

                    - My days of fighting are over. I do not seek revenge.

                    - But you two…

                    - …

                    - Should you so desire, the next part of the CORE is located in the mountain.

                    - It is supplying a group of undead AI who named themselves “_The Datura_.”

                    - …

                    - If you must, I ask you proceed with caution.

                    - I don’t want you to end up like everyone else.

                - Gamma takes it at an almost comical speed. Honey laughs sadly.

                - “To get up the mountain, you must go through hordes of CORES and AI. You have to travel through a forest which not even I have progressed.”

                - Gamma stops her. “Then so be it! We don’t make any difference here anyway!! We either live or live long enough to be killed, and if I even have the _chance_ to make a difference, then why would I give that up?! I’ll be killed, that’s it. Yeah, I know! But, if I can at least…”

                - Nea looks down, ashamed.

                - Honey hesitates. “…”

                - “I don’t see a passion much like yours anymore, much less in a _clone_.”

                - Gamma stands up. “Being a clone doesn’t mean jackshit! If yer here ta just rail on me for bein’ one, then—!”

                - “Tch!” Honey stands up and forces her down. “All this _this_ and _that_ that yer goin’ on about! Calm down!”

                - Gamma and Nea glance at each other awkwardly.

                - “What I _mean_,” Honey says. “Is you’ve got a heart. Not a great thing, but not a bad thing, either.”

                - “…”

                - “I—..” Honey rubs her temples. “I.. You two..”

                - “…”

                - “… are absolutely _insufferable!!_” Honey groans. “Pack up! We’re leaving tomorrow!”

                - Nea stiffens. “Wh-what?!”

                - “You heard me! Hey, Han! Get ‘em a room! Chasmus, take it outta my check. I got work ta do, go pack up an’ get up!”

                - “w-we already have a—”

                - “LOCK ‘EM UP!!!”

        - … So Gamma and Nea sleep for the night, and are awoken at 3 AM by Honeycakes.

            - “c’mon! this is baby work!” Honey swings her hammer over her shoulder. “Y’all are pathetic! Overthrowing a world leader and ya can’t even get up? C’mon!”

        - … And they go to the mountain.

        - CTSNE of Honey breaking down the rusty gates leading up. Gamma laughs.

            - “Damn! we’ve got nothin ta worry about, huh?” She puts her arms behind her head. “With _that_, you can even rival Omega!”

            - “… The one who beat up Pyrrhon?”

            - Gamma nods.

            - Nea perks up. “Y-yeah! they were the same color as you, Gamma!”

            - “Gen 3 clone!” Gamma puffs up her chest. “We’re the last sentient clones around coz of him! Hah!”

            - Honey scratches the back of her head. “That’s not something to brag about.”

            - “By the way,” Gamma says, “What Division were you? I was 12.”

            - “Shut up!” Honey says. “We’re here to bash in skulls, not talk about your tragic backstory! Hurry up!!”

        - Stage 1 — Honey

            - You play as Gamma and Nea for a bit until you get to a puzzle that only Honey can do. she chastises them and plows through it for them. You get to play as just her for the rest of the level, which isn’t very much.

                - Should be medium difficulty of more puzzles and exploration with minimal fighting until the end. Precision platforming

        - Stage 2 — The Datura

            - Small fighting sequence with the Datura AI. Gamma complains that they’re stronger than usual and Honey snaps that it’s the CORE. If it’s the CORE you wanna get, it’s the CORE you must defeat!

                - This stage is more of a fighting stage than the last. After the first wave, you explore a small maze to heal, then fight a secondary wave.

        - Stage 3 — Rattlesnake in the flowers

            - Woah, the CORE is right there, unguarded!

                - No, no it’s not. Python’s guarding it.

                    - Nea screams, exasperated. “ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?”

                    - Honeycakes grips her hammer. “We’re going after her!”

                - The walls suddenly begin to close in (they’re indoors) and it’s a speed precision race to the end of the level.

                    - If you do a secret level you can get Gamma’s motorcycle

        - Stage 4 — Python

            - RUH roh it’s the Datura again!!! You bash in a round until you encounter Python.

                - Insert conversation

            - Python boss fight

            - obtain bit of CORE!

                - “Is that it?” Asks Gamma.

                - Honey shakes her head. “Nope. That bitch ass cut it up. Looks like the Datura got some. Let’s kill em!”

        - Stage 5 — Venom

            - Python again :skull:

                - Gamma says, “Leave us alone! We don’t want nothing with you!”

                - Python Points towards Honey: “It’s not _you two_ I want.”

                    - Honey/Python conflict
                        
                        G: H-hold on! Honey can’t—.. That .. Omega’s a _clone!_ Honey-Honey.. she’s—
                        
                        P: and how do you think she obtained such a high power weapon? She hasn’t worked with the temples to obtain magic, right, Nea? N: …
                        
                        P: And Gamma, your fists, they’re magic, aren’t they?
                        
                        G: but…
                        
                        P: And what does that make you, Honeycakes? Non-religious magic possessor?
                        
                        H: …
                        
                        H: …
                        
                        H: … It’s been a while, Python.
                        
                        G: Honey—?!
                        
                        (Honey swings out her hammer)
                        
                        P: Ah? I save your life, and this is the thanks I get?!
                        
                        H: Tch!
                        
                        P: A murderer, that’s what you always were! Just take out my CORE like you never even knew me in the first place! I _dare_ you!
                        
                        P: and you.. you’ve got a following, don’t you now?
                        
                        P: Hah.. hahah… you’re probably lying to them, too huh?!
                        
                        P: PATHETIC!!
                        
                        P: Come on, Honey!
                        
                        P: Life’s just a game, right?! Isn’t that what you told me?!
                        
                        P: SO WHAT’S WRONG WITH FIGHTING TIL MY DEATH?!?!
                        
                        _Battle start_
                        
                    - Something something. Fight her.
                        
                    - Something else. Fight the Datura
                        
                        - This is possibly the hardest fight here then.

            - Well after that fiasco (survive long enough, lol. You can’t defeat every single enemy, it’s an endless wave until the timer runs out) and an unskippable death plays out.

                - They are separated by Khan , with the last piece of the CORE, who comes to fully activate it. The blow upon activation is so insanely powerful that:

                    - Honey and Gamma are blown away

                    - Nea and Python are blown away.

                - Chasmus is left alone.

    - Stage 6 — Memory Cards
        
    - Nea, Lane, Const, and Prodigal.
        
    - Gamma and Nea wake up in a dingy alleyway in a common city.
        
        - As they start to walk around, Nea gets a splitting headache and falls tot he ground.

            - G: “N—.. Nea?! Are you okay?!”

            - N: “Gh .. damn—.. damn fuckin’ w.. ah..”

            - G: “_Oh.. Right, CORE density is much higher here.”_

            - G: “D-don’t worry! I’ll.. I’ll get you somewhere safe!!”

            - N: “I-.. I’m sorry..”

            - Gamma hefts Nea on her back

                - Oh shit it’s Lane and Prodigal!!

        - Prodigal kidnaps gamma, and leaves Nea on the ground. Cue quickly moving stage with hard obstacles.

        - After the stage, small cutscene of Nea spying on Prodigal and her group (Lock, Lane, and Conte) and dragging Gamma away like a spider in a web.

        - Nea tries to sneak out, but is caught by Conte and Lock who do a combo attack and kick her out.

    - Cue Constantine
        
        - They catch her as she falls.

            - They’d gone to D4 for business, but for some reason caught a nerualink of Gamma and decided to come over.

            - Constantine is here to deliver a USB of blackmail to someone in the underworld.

        - “Well, what are you guys wanting for?!” Nea points towards the giant building Prodigal ran off to. “Let’s go find Gamma!”

    - This dungeon.. **is incredibly long!**
        
        - 4 waves of enemies, and 2 waves of puzzle.

            - The first puzzle wave is just for entering the building, the other one is for getting to the 4th wave and then Prodigal. 2nd wave is more complicated.

            - Each wave includes a different challenge (ie consistent bleed, projectiles, immobilized, more projectiles but it’s bigger).

        - At the end, they get into a glass elevator and go up to the sky. You can vaguely see the conflict with Khan, Python, and Honey, but they pay it no mind.

    - When you finish, cut to Gamma.
        
        - You walk out of your cage, and into an eerily quiet hallway.

        - You find yourself back in Future, trying to escape.

            - It’s actually almost impossible to lose here; you have almost infinite health and deal insane damage.

            - Upon reaching the end, you fall down onto Earth, look up, and—!

        - Oh, it’s just Prodigal.

            - You’re tied up against a wall and she’s staring at you intently.

            - A bad robotic voice asks, “Do you remember?”

                - Prodigal slams her fist the wall beside Gamma.

            - “Do you remember? What we did?”

            - “All those years..”

            - “Do you remember

            - Who helped you escape from Future?”

            - Do you remember

            - _anything?_

    - Nea and Constantine break in from the ceiling and throw Lock and Conte off the sides. Prodigal tries to escape through the ceiling, but Honey throws her down.
        
        - Constantine gets Gamma off of the wall and Shenx looks around.

    - And shit goes down.
        
        - It basically escalates to puzzle → Lane/Prodigal → puzzle → Lane/Prodigal again, with Gamma 4life required.
            
        - During the first puzzle, Lane says, “I won’t let you hurt her!!” And once she is defeated, Prodigal takes her and runs away. During the second puzzle, Lane tries again, saying, “Don’t take her away from me!!” But she ends up falling to the ground.
            
            - Prodigal asks one more time.

            - “Do you remember me?”

            - Gamma slides back and spits blood onto the ground

            - “Hell no!”

            - Prodigal jams her against the wall and presses her thumb into Gamma’s forehead

                - When Gamma fell in future, she saw Pyrrhon, who held a gun.

                - She also saw Prodigal.

                    - She remembers prodigal.

                        - Flashbacks of how Prodigal helped her before, helped her fight,

                - Pyrrhon says, “night night~”

                - And the video glitches to black.

            - Prodigal asks.

            - “Do you remember me?”

        - The conversation
            
            Gamma:  “You’re here.”
            
            Prodigal: “I’m here.”
            
            Gamma:  “Are you pleased with yourself?”
            
            Gamma:  “Do you enjoy killing everybody in sight? Do you get some sorta sick high off of seeing people scream and cry and—!”
            
            Prodigal: “Gamma..”
            
            Prodigal: ” .. You win.”
            
            Prodigal: “I can’t live knowing I lost.. Everything..”
            
            Prodigal: “It’s all gone. What’s left of me?”
            
            Prodigal: “I can’t live knowing that she—“
            
            Prodigal: “..”
            
            Prodigal: “The consequences are far too great for me to return home empty handed.”
            
            Prodigal: “Please allow me to have this one thing. The only freedom I’ll ever get.”
            
            Prodigal: “I lost.”
            
            Prodigal: “You win, okay?”
            
            Prodigal: “Take my CORE.”
            
            Prodigal: “You win.”
            
            Gamma:  “..”
            
            [Gamma’s hands fall to her side].
            
            Prodigal: “.. I’m sorry.”
            
            Gamma:  “..”
            
            Prodigal: “I know you can’t- can’t ever forgive me, but..”
            
            Prodigal: “I have to thank you.”
            
            Prodigal: “I found you.”
            
            Gamma: “..?”
            
            Prodigal: “My sole reason for existence.”
            
            Prodigal: “To find you.”
            
            Prodigal: “Gamma, you..”
            
            Prodigal: “As much as you hated me, I couldn’t stop.”
            
            Prodigal: “But, I couldn’t stand how they treated you.”
            
            Prodigal: “You remember, right? The cloning facility.”
            
            Gamma: “..”
            
            Prodigal: “A clone of my being..”
            
            Prodigal: ” And yet, human despite it all.”
            
            Prodigal: ” I couldn’t let them take that away from you.”
            
            Prodigal: “Hahah. You ran away from me, didn’t you? I was the reason you’re here now with your scars and burnt edges.”
            
            Prodigal: “Gamma..”
            
            Prodigal: “I know you hated me.”
            
            Prodigal: “But I didn’t hate you.”
            
            Prodigal: “I just—..”
            
            Prodigal: “(shiver, cough)”
            
            Prodigal: “I just really..”
            
            Prodigal: “I’m just glad I can spend my last moments with you.”
            
            Prodigal: “My little sister..”
            
            Prodigal: “Ohh..”
            
            Gamma:  “H-hey—!”
            
            Prodigal: “Take my CORE.”
            
            Prodigal: “Put my metal carcass of a soul to good use, okay?”
            
            Gamma:  “Puh..”
            
            Gamma:  “Prodigal, you—?!”
            
            Prodigal: “Please just—“
            
            Gamma:  “Prodigal, are you—!?”
            
            [Prodigal flops down on the floor].
            
            Prodigal: “.. Please.”
            
            Gamma:  “What are you—?!”
            
            Prodigal: “She took you away from me, and I—”
            
            Prodigal: “.. Your pitiful expression, that day..”
            
            Prodigal: “It was too much for me.”
            
            Prodigal: “I’ve done too much wrong for God to save me now.”
            
            [Gamma grabs Prodigal’s hand]
            
            Gamma:  “Prodigal just—!..”
            
            Gamma:  “Why—.. Why couldn’t you have—?!”
            
            Prodigal: “I’ve done too much wrong.”
            
            Prodigal: “I’m sorry.”
            
            Gamma:  “YOU IDIOT!”
            
            [Gamma slams the ground]
            
            Gamma:  “WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME?!”
            
            Gamma:  “WHY DIDNT YOU—?!”
            
            (Gamma wipes away tears)
            
            Gamma:  “I.. I could’ve saved you, Prodigal..! I-I thought that—!”
            
            Prodigal: “I never hated you.”
            
            Gamma:  “I know. I know but why—“
            
            Gamma:  “.. Why coulnd’t you have told me?”
            
            Gamma:  “So that I—.”
            
            Gamma:  “.. I wouldn’t have—!”
            
            Prodigal: “Look at you now.”
            
            [Prodigal lifts a shaking hand onto Gamma’s chest or hand]
            
            Prodigal: “You’re beautiful.”
            
            Prodigal: “Aren’t you?”
            
            [Prodigal laughs quietly]
            
            Prodigal: “Oh, Gamma..”
            
            Prodigal: “If only I—..”
            
            Gamma:  “PRODIGAL!”
            
            Prodigal: “I’m just glad I..”
            
            Prodigal: “.. can spend my last moments..”
            
            Prodigal: “with you.”
            
            Prodigal: “My baby sister..”
            
            Gamma:  “Prod-.. PRODIGAL?!”
            
            Prodigal fucking SHOOTS herself
            
            Gamma:  “PRODIGAL! WAKE UP! PRODIGAL! PRODIGAL!”
            
            [Gamma shakes Prodigal frantically, but her core flies out].
            
            Prodigal faded away into the night, melting away with the distant summer sun.
            
            The only fading memory of Prodigal, her CORE, the very bane of her existence, rests in Gamma’s bloodied hands.
            
            …
            
            Gamma equips Prodigal’s CORE.
            
            …
            
            …
            
            Lane shows up beside Gamma, and stares at Prodigal’s empty carcass.
            
            A slash,
            
            and Lane is also nothing but a desecrated corpse.
            
            …
            
            …
            
    
    Nea reconvenes with Gamma, who is still, and can’t move.
    
    She hugs Gamma, who passes out upon touch.
    
    …
    
    …
    
    Honey’s CORE is one half fuller. Prodigal had the third piece.
    
    …
    
    …

Act 3: The Hive

- Crossing Over the Line
    
    Refresh your memory, or when you wanna be, the Phantom’s on the way, She’s coming down the street.
    
    Summer lights, seems to me, I’m in a dream.
    
    This summer night…
    
    Huangzhi
    
    Khan, Python, Honey, Kai, and _The Avatar_.
    
    - Back at the Slaughterhouse, Gamma’s finally woken back up. She doesn’t seem to feel like talking, but says, “Let’s go.” anyway.
        
        - the CORE’s one half fuller. two more chunks to go.

            - One is with Python, the other with someone else

    - however, the conflict with Prodigal brought Honey’s CORE to the attention of Pyrrhon, who set off after them.
        
        - As they leave The Slaughterhouse, Gamma, Nea, and Honey are tracked down by police and chased.

            - if you get caught it’s a game over— you have to run to the next town over before they give up.

                - This town is similar to a beehive. They throw a man to the ground as they go and he is shot down by police.

        - Due to Honey’s mass amount of strength, she is mistaken for a temple leader and is whisked away. Gamma and Nea are left alone.

            - Follow Honey, she tries to fight but is put down by what looks like DGM CROW’s talismans.
                
            - Turns out the guy that they killed at the entrance was a high level temple leader… Nea has a panic attack as she realizes he died (shot by police). They currently mistake Honey to be that man. He didn’t have a determinable gender so they just say she’s a girl.
                
                - she makes up a bullshit response which is obviously fake but fucking works anyway. You learn a small bit of her past through a flashback.

                    - Gamma and Nea sneak into her room via the window at the top of her ceiling. She’s happy!

            - At this time, you can now do side quests in this town.
                
                - it’s recommended you do at least one so you can unlock the inns and shops in this town.

                - When they go outside, Honey sees Python. She summons her hammer ready to strike—

                    - She holds a small girl by her ponytail, and plugs the CORE into her.

                        - ??? “… P—.. Python..?”

                        - P “Shh.. shh, you’re still weak. Are you okay?”

                        - ??? “My-my master, he—..”

                        - P “shh.. it’s okay. You’ll be okay.”

                        - ??? “P-Python, I—.. I’m so sorry, y-you..”

                        - P “Calm down. It’s not that big of a deal. It wasn’t that hard, don’t worry.”

                            - Python puts her injured arm behind her back and continues to stroke the girl’s head.

                    - …

                    - …

                    - You can choose to still attack Python or not

            - Attacked
                
                The bad ending.
                
                - You strike, and Python flinches.

                - You have struck the girl and killed her.

                - Python stares at the girl in tears.

                    - H. “…”

                    - P “…” ”You-..”

                    - H “…”

                    - P “I’m going to kill you, Honey.” ”I’m going to fucking kill you.” ”I’ll kill you.” ”I’ll kill you.”

                        - a DDLC esque glitch sequence sends Honey back to her room.

                            - Knock Knock Knock, Honey’s woken up by guns. Gamma and Nea are nowhere to be found.

                            - She prioritizes herself and runs out of a really fucking dangerous dungeon outside of the town.

                            - She slips and falls suddenly, and someone puts their feet on her back.

                                - Huangzhi says, “I got her. Take her in.”

                                    - The police show up, lead by Python. the CORE is implemented into _her_, embedded in to her back.

                                        - “… Police, dismiss. I will handle her.” they disperse. ”This is our fight, Honey.” ”Will you fight me, or die like a dog?”

                                            - The hardest boss fight in the game starts here, lol.

                                            - it’s kind of impossible to win and it generally just encourages you to go show mercy to Python, the longer route.

                                                - If you manage to beat her with just Honey on two lives, you wrench the CORE out of her back and kill her.

                                                - Python is dead, but the CORE is 25% fuller.

                                                - you return to the town like nothing happened.

            - Mercy
                
                The good ending.
                
                - You just get up and leave. Nearby guards ask Honey if she saw an intruder, but she declines.

                    - P. “…”

                    - H. “…”

                    - P. “Thanks.”

                        - Python leaves with the girl. She leaves behind a really good weapon upgrader.

                - Alright, so! You return back to your room.

                    - You might want to add more stuff in here.

                        - So you go into the hallway: Khan, and a few other people are there. While you try to refuse walking into the room, they refuse you.. haha.

                        - They talk to Honey and vaguely hint that they know who she is. When her fingers inch towards her Kendama, they tie her up immidletly and throw her at the bottom of an arena.

                        - Huangzhi sits there with Khan, twirling a key.

                        - “Go.”

                        - All of the NPCs from the town or temple attack you. When you get closer…

                            - Khan takes the CORE off of the pedestal, and then inserts it into a little boy. He attacks Honey.

                                - After winning (or, ‘winning’), Honey is thrown back and almost gets hit, until the attack is blocked…

                                    - “Just like old times, huh?”

                                    - It’s Python! Similarly to the Ummu fight, she assists you.

                                        - After the fight, there’s a looong scene of an explosion. You seem to have won, the temple is in shambles, and no one can be seen.

                                            - And then a missile is shot into Python’s back. You have two seconds to press “x” to grab.

                                                - if you don’t, then the (INSERT GANG HERE) will attack you. if you do, they will stop and provide healing every now and then. That’s the only difference it has.

                                        - You catch a mild glimpse of PYRRHON.

                                        - She saw you.

                                        - She knows

                            - Honey runs with Python through the forest while being chased by Pyrrhon, who runs at lightspeed. Honey is thrown off of a cliff—

                                - She starts to fall,

                                    - is this how it ends? I never even got to meet my mother, I never even got to..

                                    - I worked so hard..

                                    - is this the life I get?

                                - her hands are grabbed by Python, who’s leaning off of a boat controlled by Gamma and Nea. She’s hoisted onto the boat and runs off.

                            - As they hop back on land, the boat crashes but no one pays it any mind. A gang of bandits suddenly come out with knives. Gamma and Nea step forward to protect Honey.

                                - “Stand down”, says Python. “It’s solved.”

                                - There’s a group of groans and they all walk away.

                                    - “You were going to AMBUSH me?!”

                                    - “I DIDN’T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO REACT!!’

                                    - “REACT TO WHAT?!?!?!?”

                                    - Gamma and Nea look at each other and sigh.

                                - Camera pan.

                            - Python sits atop the cliff, and gestures Khan away. Huangzhi later comes over, but he is thrown into the ocean.

                - End of act 3.
        
        End of act three.

Act 4: Late Loves Lamentations

- The world’s on fire.
    - After the HIVE, Nea and Gamma go to a nearby cave where they see Rhaika Lei making a campfire and meditating. You can rest with him.

    - Upon interacting with him, he just opens one of his eyes, but says nothing, and goes back to normal.

    - Behind him, there’s a door you can go into.

        - It’s a gorgeous place, reminiscent of an old Catholic Church. At the center, there’s a small statue and sword that is embedded into the chest of a small girl. It’s a human girl. This is a cutscene.

        - You can take it out, but Rhaika Lei will rush in and throw a dagger at your face. He doesn’t talk again, but you do duke it out again.

    - If you win, he staggers back. He chokes on his own words. You pull out the sword.

        - “Who dares disturb my slumber?” Blah blah blah.

    - Rhaika Lei spits out a black glob, which manifests itself into a spider and crawls into the statue. He starts coughing and sputtering.

    - It’s then that the statues eyes light up, and you’re trapped in a dungeon, congrats. There’s a broken fridge in there which flickers to life. You have to pay though. lol.

        - Rhaika Lei is unconscious beside you, but he’s holding a USB which you can insert into a cyborg.

            - It details the tale of Kei, Kai, and Pyrrhon’s conquest against God. It brings into question that there is more than known.

        - Rhaika Lei snaps the USB out of you, then runs away.

    - When you see him next, he’s inserted it into an old mech, which he tries to use to fight you, but is stricken down by Kai, who descends down.

    - “There is no need for your services, Rhaika Lei. You have done well. And you four… why have you summoned me?”

    - “I don’t know.”

    - “…”

    - “…”

    - “You expelled a curse for..?”

    - “For fun.”

    - “…”

    - “…”

    - “Uh,” Kai slumps down. “… Do you need my help?”

    - “Yeah, wanna stop a world leader with us?” Gamma jokes. Kai laughs and says sure. As the party member screen opens, it’s cut in half. Kai is sputtering for breath. Her blood leaks into Rhaika Lei’s dead corpse.
    

# Prequel Story + LORE

(my first draft,, i lost the other one) XD

It’s a dingy night.

A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion.

Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes.

He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake.

The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn’t matter, none of it did.

Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes.

Earth, in 2XXX. 2012, God fell from the heavens. Angels crashed and burned, and all left behind in the slaughter was a small, gleaning green gem. That’s the PRODIGAL CORE, rumored to be the Core of life itself, the heart of God Himself. From the “rapture”, as it was called, 75% of Earth was wiped out. 75% of Earth is “No Man’s Land”, and 25% is all under control of _Pyrrhon_. Pyrrhon’s the maniacal maniac who harnessed the full power of the PRODIGAL CORE and brought Earth from the depths of hell: for a cost.

All you need to know is now, Pyrrhon is in complete and total control of earth and its inhabitants. She runs “OZ”, the world IS OZ. There may be a government, but OZ holds so much power that they are completely powerless. Should OZ be brought down, so would the entire economy of the planet.

Pyrrhon is a scientist, as mentioned. She and her friend, Reever, specifically had an interest in human experimentation. One of my many interests is human cloning! You might be able to see where this is going.

All clones and nuclear experiments are done on small asteroid planets. One particularly noted is called FUTURE, where a lot of clones are produced. you might see the name “Gamma” mentioned— she is a clone from here!

In OZ, there’s sub-categories. One of these sub categories is the NATIONAL GUARDIAN team.

A national guardian is basically the _only_ good job you can get without nepotism. On the outside, you fight. Defend the country. Become police, etc. that’s it.

Then you join the National guardian team.

It’s a dingy night.

A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion.

Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes.

He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake.

The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn’t matter, none of it did.

Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes.

Marian signs away to the National Guardian— a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him.

He is placed in a group with a grumpy old man as his leader, and another boy, named Khan. Khan has joined hte national guardian team to garner funds for his sister, who has unfortunately died before this point but now he can’t really leave.

It’s here that they’re given a CORE

A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There’s a rumor that Pyrrhon  was the one who killed God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him.

A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it?

A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action.

Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN’s whole lifetime can’t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful.

You level up your CORE using other’s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it’s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth.

You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE’s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it.

The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist.

Now, in order to clone, you need eggs to produce them in. A girl named Chou is a donor, and has been for the past year or so. She’s developed a platonic relationship with Khan, so he lives on for her. Anyway

Anyway I forgot most of what happens in the prequel story, but blah blah blah immortality blah blah blah, Khan and Marian are homoerotic enemies blah blah blah Chou joins their team,here’s where things get really bad.

Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Whether it be his hard head and big muscles or his strange moral compass, she loves him. And she can do whatever she wants with him.

“It doesn't have to be human,” says Pyrrhon, “It just has to be _you_.”

….

On November 12, 2XXX, a child is born.

That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates.

He goes on his last mission with Khan and Chou, putting down a rebellion against Oz by a small group called The Last Hope, and Marian is so DONE.

He gazes into Nea’s eyes,

He realizes that he really _does_ love Nea.

Marian refuses to fight from this point on. He gives his magically-infused scarf to Khan, a soft kiss, and then runs into the night. Khan can only stare in awe.

Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl.  He’s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously).

He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child.

- At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power.

Nea could really care less.

Until she walks into her room and sees her father’s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman?

“My daughter,” she says to Nea. “I found you.”

”I am not your daughter.”

Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal.

Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart.

Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions.

Nea looks up at Pyrrhon.

Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires.

Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter.

Nea’s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon’s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon’s smart. Why else is she a world leader?

Her father lays motionless.

Pyrrhon only grins.

All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames.

She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames.

She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing.

(first dra

- Pre-Established
    
    Basically, Khan and Marian were lumped in with this grumpy ass old man. I think Pyrrhon saw their backgrounds (Khan joined to get funds for his little sister, who was ill) and Marian ran away from his religious training and said “fuck you brah” so she put them with the worst possible guy. So this grumpy old man worked their asses off, to try to get into this huge competition in an arena, so that they’d become National guardians. So they train and train and hate each other and love each other a little, and they end up winning that competition and make it into the national guardian association. Khan becomes kind of an egotistical BITCH at this time and leaves Marian who kind of set him up for the final blow which had them win. Marian sulks around, and he wanders back to his old hut with his master, and oh my god he’s fuckign dead :sob: He doesn’t even tell Khan, he just buries his master by himself. While in the forest, he meets this tiny little girl named Chou. She’s bright blue (like gamma) and missing one eye. She’s relaly, really scared like trembling shaking crying .. he feels pity for her and takes her to the infirmary. She actually thinks that Marian is _Khan_ for some reason, but he doesn’t say anything. Anyway, it turns out that Khan’s sister actually fucking died a long time ago, so he took Chou under his wing to take care of. But since he’s been too busy doing whatever shit he does, she’s been lonely. Marian like an idiot, leaves her, and brawls with Marian for like, three hours. He does actually apologize and realize his wrongs, goes to Chou, and they both “adopt” her, basically. Chou is part of the genetic testing batch and was chosen to be a gene donor to some of the clones, so she’s whisked away. They both stop by a bar and kinda go over what’s happened to them so far. How far they’ve come. How they’re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. Actually, before this time, Marian and Pyrrhon had their, uhm! Their run in.
    
    So, now they’ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they’re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them.
    
    They go to a small town. Since it’s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon’s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it’s not within Pyrrhon’s rules, it’s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. Anyway, they end up putting TLH to rest here, and Marian slams his sword down. “I’m done with this,” he says. “I can’t do this anymore.” Khan can’t say much. He doesn’t have much to say. He gets it, but, “You’re going to leave us?” “I don’t have to,” says Marian. “You can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?” “But—“ “But what? We-we’ll cook together and live together, and Chou’ll be fine, and Pyrrhon’s gonna leave us alone, and..” “…” “…” “Stupid, isn’t it? That’s what you’d say. But it can happen! I promise you.” “I—..” “..” “I can’t leave, Marian.” “…” “But I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.” Khan wraps his scarf around Marian’s neck. “I’ll miss you, Marian.” Marian smiles wistfully. “I hope to see you again.” (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian joins a small temple in the middle of nowhere. Climbs up the ranks. brings Nea, who;d been born, with him. And Pyrrhon..
    

OLD DRAFT

- They’re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan.
    - “Kill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!”

        - Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight.

            - Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua’s story mode.

        - You have three tries until it skips for you.

- So, Nea’s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There’s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there.
    - Nea finally wins.

        - “Tch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.”

        - ”A murderer. That’s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone’s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father’s sword to kill his last remaining memory.”

- Nea’s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE.
    - “I’m more mature than that, you know.”

    - “…”

    - “I won’t kill you. But I do want to know some things.”

    - “Like hell I’d—“

    - “How do you know my father?”

    - “…”

- Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon’s public safety detection system.
    - They both silently forgive each other.

        - If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue:

        - “We need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.”

        - “Hey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.”

        - “You think I’d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don’t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!”

        - “Hah? What, a senior citizen discount?”

        - “… I get two discounts.”

        - (huh!) “..You know, you’re surprisingly fit..”

        - “?”

        - “.. For a FOSSIL.”

        - Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles.

        - Screen fade to black.

            - Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing.

            - Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn’t too happy.

- The next morning, Nea’s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag.
    - “I’m going to get Gamma. Stay here.”

    - “I can’t lose her…”

    - “?”

    - “Just like I lost him.”

    - “How would I be able to trust you? You don’t even know her.”

    - “You don’t even know me. Be mature about this.”

    - “…”

    - “…”

    - “Fine. Let’s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I’ll—“

    - You think I’d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.”

        - They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way.

            - Khan has very high base stats but he’s very hard to use. He’s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level.

                - He’s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul’s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin’s chains or valentine’s vials).

            - **Alt Khan can’t actually help you </3**

        - This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It’s just an aoe fun run.

    - They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn’t there. Actually, no one’s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded.

After Nea escapes from Future, she has a run in with some guy and Point helps her get a CORE outta one of the PiBots. So, she does that.

Gamma comes along and screams, outta my way!

She takes that CORE. Point tells Nea to get out.

if you get out, you can’t because Gamma challenges you and is like “Izzat point? Goddamn! He really won’t leave me alone.”

“Five second rule, yk? Gotta get it fresh.”

She jams your transmissions and then you fight.

The same thing happens if you walk towards her, just with different intro dialogue.

- *YOU CAN ONLY DEFEAT GAMMA USING A BLOCKBUSTER, or whatever the equal is. It’s because she’s metal and she’s weak to Magic.
- Dream magic and reg Magic should be a thing. Nea uses Dream Magic

She gives up after the first hit from the blockbuxaster and then Gamma just leaves because her pride is hurt. She throws you the CORE and hops away.

Okay so you leave into the forest and then uh oh, it’s Gamma. She staggers towards you and begs for a truce. She even gives you her powerbank, which she’s using to power her PiCORE, since she has no external energy to grab.

You guys can talk. You can ask her how she knows Point, or who she is.

- She dances around answering about Point, but they were in the resistance before together :) they tried getting together, and actually kissed! But Gamma is a lesbian (point is gay too) so they don’t really like each other, but they’re just too embarrassed. They kissed before the resistance force shelter was bombed.

OH OH SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT where you’re from!

- “The over world..? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!”

She gets all sentimental on you.

- “What’s it like? I hear it’s being overrun by politicians right now… Oh, really? There’s really no safe space on Earth anymore, huh?”

> “You need to talk to Point? .. Oh.”

She gives you her powerbank (like just shoves it in her hands), stating that she doesn’t need it anymore. She needs it to fight, but she says that it’s getting harder to fight. It’s too hard. I’m so tired..

Gamma suddenly collapses. A small hologram states that she’s very low on power.

Nea just tucks Gamma into the bed next to her. The powerbank and her transmitter are on the side, she hasn’t used it yet. She kinda thKhans about it, before drifting off to sleep…

HOLY FUCK ITS PRODIGAL

Prodigal comes along and fucking BURNS the forest down. Nea slams the powerbank back into Gamma, who gets up. She’s stuck in her PiBot mode since Nea is bad with computers. Gamma scares Prodigal off, and then there’s a shot of her amidst the fire, and looking back, like the eclair cyborg picture I had. She extends a hand, and they fly off.

You can either get Nea’s route maybe or you can get Tsao and Khan maybe..

    - Bijyun opening:
        
    - A few glitches in the opener when you log in and when you immediately leave afterward.
        
        - Gamestyle:

            - A short hack-n-slash tutorial. Quick-paced and gets you over the basics, which include:

            - Grappling hooks

            - Basic movement controls

        - Extremely basic fighting controls + crouch/crouch attacks

    - Not too long for the tut sequence, but a little longer for the fighting sequence.
        
        - “Whew! You okay there, Gamma? Back on track, ‘Kay? Get going!”

    - Afterward, you get a semi-glitched cutscene, and Gamma falls to the ground.
        
        - Guess what happened here? Pyrrhon glitched Gamma’s memories! All glitching is actually the memories she had with Prodigal

    - She lands in Marian’s abandoned temple with her motorcycle, the Comet.
        
    
    Cut to Gamma at her new job.
    
    “… And now I’m here. Working under the same person, same conditions, just somewhere else.”
    
    - A testing sequence, 1v1 battle against a harder foe + a few troop waves.

        - As she tosses it up into the air (carelessly), it’s shot out of her hands and Prodigal fucking eats it.

    - Anim.cut where Gamma loses her job. She’s pretty unreliable anyway.

        - “But I—!”

        - “On ___, you failed to retrieve ___’s heart”

        - On ___ you took Lock’s left lung for your own personal gain”

        - Etc. it’s actually extremely funny how unreliable she is.

            - They throw her over the side of the fucking building because she gets into a fight

            - She lands, hard. She’s gasping for air, but somehow still clinging onto the life she once had.

                - … and then Nea falls next to her. She isn’t in as much pain as Gamma, but that throw was supposed to kill, so thank God for Gamma being there to break her fall.

                    - “… Got fired too?” Says Gamma.

                    - Nea gasps for air. “… yeah.”

                        - They just kind of, sit there. It’s raining, they’re basically going to die. There’s nowhere to go. They’re both bleeding out into each other.

                            - That’s what Nea says, at least.

                - Gamma tries to keep them both awake, but they both end up collapsing from blood loss.

        - Potential Shenx meeting instead of Huangzhi, who takes them both and says “hey Prodigal is being really mean to us and we need you guys to take her out.”
    
    _Gamma was an experiment to make a clone as ‘human’ as possible. Prodigal was the second part to make the clone as robotic as possible. With this, they studied how they fared in battle situations._
    
    _Prodigal was genuinely fucking FASCINATED with Gamma, like obsessively, and stalked her around. Gamma really hated Prodigal for that. Actually, Gamma was barely aware of Prodi’s existence. Pyrrhon did everything in her power to keep them separated._
    
    _This is where the “Prodigal Boss” Lore comes into play._
    
    _She finds Gamma with Nea, who she sort of just observes from a distance. Think Hornet, from Hollow Knight, or Road, from D. Gray-Man. Yes, she causes all sorts of issues, but they never come face to face._
    
    _But tensions build._
    
    _At the end of a chase scene, Nea stabs down Prodigal. Prodigal doesn’t even fight, and only falls limply to the ground._

    Gamma equips Prodigal’s CORE.
    
    - Post Demolition

        - Introduce Prodial!~

        - REWRITING HEAVILY

        - DRAFT

        - They’re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan.

            - “Kill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!”

                - Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight.

                    - Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua’s story mode.

                - You have three tries until it skips for you.

        - So, Nea’s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There’s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there.

            - Nea finally wins.

                - “Tch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.”

                - ”A murderer. That’s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone’s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father’s sword to kill his last remaining memory.”

        - Nea’s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE.

            - “I’m more mature than that, you know.”

            - “…”

            - “I won’t kill you. But I do want to know some things.”

            - “Like hell I’d—“

            - “How do you know my father?”

            - “…”

        - Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon’s public safety detection system.

            - They both silently forgive each other.

                - If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue:

                - “We need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.”

                - “Hey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.”

                - “You think I’d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don’t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!”

                - “Hah? What, a senior citizen discount?”

                - “… I get two discounts.”

                - (huh!) “..You know, you’re surprisingly fit..”

                - “?”

                - “.. For a FOSSIL.”

                - Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles.

                - Screen fade to black.

                    - Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing.

                    - Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn’t too happy.

        - The next morning, Nea’s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag.

            - “I’m going to get Gamma. Stay here.”

            - “I can’t lose her…”

            - “?”

            - “Just like I lost him.”

            - “How would I be able to trust you? You don’t even know her.”

            - “You don’t even know me. Be mature about this.”

            - “…”

            - “…”

            - “Fine. Let’s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I’ll—“

            - You think I’d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.”

                - They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way.

                    - Khan has very high base stats but he’s very hard to use. He’s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level.

                        - He’s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul’s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin’s chains or valentine’s vials).

                    - **Alt Khan can’t actually help you </3**

                - This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It’s just an aoe fun run.

            - They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn’t there. Actually, no one’s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded.

        - Meanwhile, with Gamma..

            - Running through the forest. She ate a mysterious fruit (tomato) earlier, and is beginning to choke.

                - She’s not allergic— did you know thai8t Clones have extremely strict dietary restrictions? Ref to the acid reflux.

                - Someone (who is a little easily seen from the background) hops out and basically like, fucking guts her.

                    - I’m kidding. What she does is open the latch on her stomach which pours out some of the stomach acid.

            - Gamma shakily gets up.

                - “… wh-who..?!”

                - “Yer lucky you’re a gen 3 clone. Any higher an’ ya would’ve died already.”

                    - Gamma’s eyes widen.

                - “You’re a c—!!”

                - “Same batch as you. Humanities, Div 3. Pleased to meetcha.”

                    - Honey shakes her hand.

                - “You can call me Honey. ‘S what my friend calls me. Any other name an’ I gut ya you for parts, ‘Kay?”

                - “… Gamma.”

                - “A pleasure. Where ya headed?”

                - “Uhm…”

            - The story so far is explained with a fade to black.

                - Honey puts her hands behind her back.

                    - “You wanna find ‘em?”

                        - Gamma nods.

                    - “Saw sum suspicious figures while I was fishin’. Old fart and bratty monk.”

                    - “Monk?”

                    - “She’s got the marking’s of one. Star an’ refined magic an everything.

                    - “… Huh.”

                    - “Prolly resigned if she’s talkin with you. | Ah, look at that. We’re here.”

                        - (Opening to the new island, the one where Honey and Constantine are. The one that’s a Baguio/Bontoc replica).

                    - “But-but—!”

                    - “Shh. Yer injured. I’ve adopted you. I’m obligated to.”

                    - “…”

                    - “What, wanna go fight?”

                    - “I can’t just leave them!”

                        - Honey kind of stares at her for a second, and then punches her.

                            - She flies across the map and ragdoll collides with the window barriers. Very loose physics.

                    - “If you can’t even beat me, how do you expect to save your friends?”

                    - “…”

                    - “See? Okay. I get a discount, since my girlfriend works there. Let’s go.”

        - Khan and Nea are tied up and about to be thrown into the incinerator. Khan says something about her father, and then—!

            - “I’m glad it was me and not her,” says Nea.

            - “I’m glad you can’t see me like this,” says Khan, to Marian (depending on who you’re playing as).

            - Honey and Gamma show up, and you do an equally fun aoe damage dungeon with them instead.

        - Khan and Honey give each other glares at the end but Nea and Gamma are happy to see each other again.

        - “So, now what?”

        - Gamma and Nea sit at the edge of the cliff and point towards Pyrrhon’s empire in the distant summer sunset.

            - “There.”

                - Cool perspective shot of all of them, then the chapter ends.

Species

Chibao (Khan, Clementine, and Rhaikha-Lei). ChiBao’s live for a very long time, they’re like the elf equivalent in CORE. It is a male dominated culture, with women being very rare and held at utmost care. When you think of magic capabilities, these are the ones you think of. These are the pioneers of magic creation, even the controversial refined magic. From the start to the end, magic has run through the veins of the ChiBao.

- Stats They tend to lean towards speed and offense with low Defense and HP. This is because they don’t usually get hit in general and use ranged attacks most often. This can vary between personalities.
- Physical Appearances Easily defined by their slender figures and pure white eyes, the ChiBao originated as a small tribe around Southeast Asia. They wear makeup made of ashes around their eyes. On occasion, they will wear the ashes of their enemies when going into war. Traditional clothing includes long, flowing hair (typically braids) and long scarves or other forms of clothing. This symbolizes their long lives. Due to their environment, their colors are usually warm/brownish colors. Their hands are absurdly large and calloused. They don’t shave off their callouses, since it serves as a natural protection against their strong magic.
- History The ChiBao are credited for the first recordings of asexual reproduction that wasn’t cloning. This was later tabooed. Their cells are completely incompatible with other species, so they can’t have other mixes of children. They eat the other ones up like acid. Consequently, there are very little ChiBao in existence today, so they’re held in generally high regard. They are a very ‘purist’ tribe, since they are physically incapable of mixing with other species. Their religion, however, is open to any species, gender, and color.
- Chiru (Nea, Chasmus, Marian, and Shenx). More magic-oriented than Inozha, but much less than the ChiBao. The ‘unicorns’ of CORE. They are so widespread, that there is no one tradition that the Chiru adapt. They instead adapt of wherever they are staying in. The most average of all the species.
    - Stats It varies between personality, but they tend to lean more towards offense OR defense. There is not one or the other. They tend to use short-ranged attacks due to their size.

    - Physical appearance It’s very common for them to be short and stubby legged, but a few have had absurd growth spurts which boost them to normal height. Since their legs are abnormal, they are prone to injury. Many people have surgery or ‘splints’ inserted into their legs, like Huangzhi. Nea simply doesn’t run very often for this fact. They have a lot of color variation, but go more towards cool, dark colors. Chiru are known for having the fastest hair growth out of anyone else.

    - History They originally began as a small nomad tribe who picked up various other wanderers of other cultures and species. Because of this.. cesspool, they eventually grew strong together and took over large parts of the Earth. they are so widespread that there is no stereotype that could fit any of them.

- Inozha (Constantine, Shou, Pyrrhon, Han, Hal, Clementine, and Coda) The secondary average tribe, but with no magic. Absolutely none. The ‘red blooded Americans’. Also extremely widespread, but stereotyped to be big, burly, and aggressive. The “earth ponies”.
    - stats Extreme offense! It’s very, very rare for them ever to rely on anything else! Brute force, amiriight?!

    - Physical Appearance Extreme color variety, from skin color to colors. These are the species that popularized clothing. Very fashionable and adaptable. They have small bodies but are extremely quick and powerful.

    - history They came in very late to the whole Stickfigure sub species scene, and when they did, they brought up the Industrial Revolution. They brought clothes, colonization, money, technology, etc to both magic oriented tribes. Because of their alliance with the Chiru, Chiru lost touch of their extreme magic capabilities over time. The Inozha are heavily credited towards .. capitalism and business.

- Nai (Honey, Gamma, Kei, Kai, Prodigal, Python, Huangzhi, and Chou). A simple term used to describe those who don’t fall into any of those categories. Everyone in here is mostly a clone.
