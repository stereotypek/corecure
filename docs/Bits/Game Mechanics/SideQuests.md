## MUTILATION
Requires reading of: [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md)
(Laying down) “ahah. Hello, Herod. I’m sorry to keep you in so long. Take a seat, [Omega](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md).” (M)
“…” (takes a seat) (O)
“No boys like me. You know why?”  (M)
“Y-you’re a.. you’re that .. that thing!”(O)
“Thing? How rude.” (M)
“Th.. then your mouth, is..?”(O)
(Rips off mouth to reveal it was sheet piece of LED and a radio) “that’s Herod. He’s my real body.”
“…”(O)
“Yes, yes.. well, you seem unaffected. That’s why I always go for soldiers. They’ve seen much, much worse.” (M)
“… your eye,”(O)
“Yes? You like it, don’t you? I’d give it to you, but.. well, yours are rarer. So be happy I dont take those~”  (M)
(.. Chou…) (O)
“The last man I met was [Khan](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md)... didn’t care how disfigured I looked. Didn’t matter how much I took out of him. He just wanted me.. Oh, I’ve never felt so flattered since Pyrrhon created me..~” (M)
“K-[Khan](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md)..?! You mean, that old hag? The one who died, like twenty years ago?!” (O)
“Hm? Oh, I…” (lie) “I met him, during his last days..~”  (M)
(Aware) “.. I see.”(O)
“I’ve never found another man so eager. Then you came along. You don’t care what I look like, do you?” (M)
“…”(O)
(Strokes little hair piece) “… hm~ I like this. You should keep it growing. I hear that it’s quite popular among young troops.” (M)
“… (blush).”(O)
“Now, shall we begin?” (M)
“But, I-…”(O)
“Getting cold feet? (Sigh) how silly. But now that you’ve seen me, I might have to kill you.”  (M)
“Don’t get ahead of yourself.”(O)
“Ho, ho? You’re strong. A really strong man..~ why don’t you come here? I’ll show you a really good night.” (M) 

Sidequest

“.. you haven’t aged a day.”(H)
“Ah? Hmm.. I see you’ve heeded my advice” (strokes Honey’s hair). “You look so beautiful like that. (Begins to feel around [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md)) and.. what’s this?”
“…”(H)
“A sex change? Well, not to worry. I don’t care. Science can do many things, including me. Hahahah.”
“I brought what you wanted.”(H)
“Hm?”
“[/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s daughter. The lover of… your lover.”(H)
“wh-what?!”(G)
“Wheel her in.” (H)
“That-.. wasn’t part of our plan!” (G)
“That’s right. It’s part of mine.”(H)
“You.. you traitor!” (G)
“Don’t forget your place. You work under me.”(H)
“… (fidgeting)”(G)
“And your eye?”(H)
“Hm? Oh, yes…” (flicks up hair) “it’s gorgeous, isn’t it? It’s fresh, too. Shame I have to give it away.”
“I don’t want that one. I want the other one.”
“Uh? The one from that little girl?”
“[Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md).”
“Ah, yes.. I remember. Your mother..~ a real cute one, she was. I loved her, so much..~ she barely lasted. Barely lasted..”
“Here.” (Tosses sandwich) “they’re mantises.”
“Ah!~ you remembered? Awww, Herod says he loves you~”
(Incomprehensible noises from Herod)
“…”
before that
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): I saved both of your pathetic lives. You’re coming with me.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): it’s … it’s 3 in the morning..?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): I’m here to beat morning traffic, not listen to you complain. Get moving. [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md), you come too.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): she’s passed out. She won’t wake up.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): is that so? Well, load her up. Make sure she doesn’t run, so tie her up.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): wh-what if she wakes up..?!
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): she’ll be fine. I won’t let anything happen to her.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): ..
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): You want to be a real clone soldier? Then listen to me. I’m your superior. Let’s get moving.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): tch.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): where are we going, anyway?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): visiting an old friend of mine. She has something I want.
(Honey drugged [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) so she wouldn’t wake up)
SO
Honey’s goal: get [Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s eye
Why? It has [Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s DNA— her DNA. 
Why? She just wants to have it.

Now, [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md) is extremely strong and quite literally revives herself. She’s rich and lives deep, deep in the mountain. She has guards and everything.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): how did you even meet her..!?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): Like me, she’s a high up. You’re a soldier, act like it.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): Y-.. yes ma’am!

Honey’s a bit suicidal which is why she made this plan up in the first place. But she’s tired of Mutiliation’s very existence, so she brings in [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md). 
She discovered that [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) has a directly opposite blood type to [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md), AND [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE. Since [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE is covered with [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)’s blood and is a newer CORE update, she will explode internally. 
So when it comes in contact with [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE, it will attempt to auto-update to absorb the CORE. However, since her CORE is a custom job, the CORE realizes that a lot of checksums are missing and then realizes that something is wrong. Since it realizes that it has been tampered with, it will corrode instantly, killing Mutilation instantly, since it will kill her before she’s able to revive herself.
The plan generally goes as planned, but when Herod goes to eat [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md), [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) snaps and attacks Mutilation. They obviously can’t fight Mutilation because they’re both outnumbered and Mutilation can very much kill the two of them. They get attacked but Honey manually restrains [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and tells Herod to eat [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md). It’s really intense. [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) is about to fucking die
Herod sinks its teeth into [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)’s shoulder, as Honey instructs. That is where [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) planted a bit of [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)’s core, so Herod recoils and begins to melt and corrode. However she put too little and Mutilation catches onto the plan and attacks them.

.. only she doesn’t.
Mutilation pins down [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) as she groggily begins to wake up and gets really freaky.

“I know ou. I know you! I KNOW YOU!!! I KNOW YUOU!!! Mother , youre my father my father my father MY FAHTER!! YOURE MY FAHTER.. “
She thinks that [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) is her father, and since it’s [/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE..
[/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) isn’t her father, she was just Pyrrhon’s ‘’lover’’
Anyway the vicinity between Mutilation and [Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE kinda fucks things up and [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) goes into a deep, deep digital flashback. so does Mutilation
It lasts a second for [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md).

But in there, [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) basically is attacked by [/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) ([mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md)). She stabs him, and [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md) says, “you’ve done so well..”
She gets flashbacks to when [/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) offered her his CORE. The sensation is so intense that it disrupts the connection and backfires on [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md), killing her instnatly. 
[Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) wakes up seeing Honey hanging up [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md) like a slab of meat and sifting through the organs she wants to keep. She has Han cool them for her in a portable cooler.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) is mostly making sure [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) is okay
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): … Alright. That’s about 10k Danari.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): wh-.. WHAT??? NO ONE IS WORTH THAT MUCH!!!
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): look at these organs. They’re branded. Don’t you see the variety? You scan them yourself. They’re soldiers— good soldiers. And these are in good shape.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): you know, if you wanted to sell organs, you could’ve just became a Merc!
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): hah. No, it was just this one time. I just wanted to get one, but.. 10k Danari is a nice farewell gift from her.❤️ 
She plucks out [Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s eye and places it into a jar. 
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): there we are.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): the hell is that?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): It’s your mother’s eye. It’s [Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s eye.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): …!
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): obviously [Chou](/Characters/NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md) is dead. I don’t intend on reviving her. Think of these as, “her ashes”.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): wh-.. what did you plan to do with them?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): look at it.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): …?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): did you think I was going to clone her? I have a business to run. I just wanted to look at her.
[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): that’s why you risked [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)’S LIFE??!
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): well, look. She’s alive, isn’t she? And she killed [Mutilation](/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md). 
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): don’t worry. You both can keep 10 thousand D each. I already counted our shares. Han! Load up the cart, we’re going to Ritas!

## The [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) Romance Quest

I had an idea
So, [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is going out shopping for vegetables. She meets this little farmer girl, named Cherry.
Cherry: my name is Cherry, like the food.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): huh! Well, my name is Honey, like the candy!
(Giggle snicker) 
They start to get along really well. Trading free food together.. cooking each other meals. 
One day, [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is invited to Cherry’s farm for dinner. Honey brought over her steamed fish. 
Cherry: Honey! Can you pass me the knife?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): Sure thing ❤️
(She passes the knife. She holds it with a throwing grip, but she doesnt throw it.)
(Dad glances at her wearily)
Dad: … you two dating?
(Cherry groans)
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): actually, no! Honey is my name!
Dad: …
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): My full name is [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md). First name honey, last name cakes. 
Dad: so.. mister cakes—
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): ms. I’m a woman.
(Dad glances at Honey’s chest)
Dad: .. are you sure?
Cherry: dad!!! Don’t do that!!
(Dad leans back in his chair): you know, back in my day, Pyrrhon’s empire didn’t allow this sort of thing! Men were soldiers, and—
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): actually, a large majority of soldiers were transgender or gay! Pyrrhon didn’t have any official laws against gay marriages, it was just because the church was so widespread 40 years ago, that it basically was a law.
Cherry: huh? How old are you?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): sixty (THIS IS A JOKE ITS UNOFFICIAL)
([Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) comes up from behind, unaware that [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is ACTUALY Omega)
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): yeah? You look really good for a sixty year old.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): tee hee ❤️ (hasn’t turned around) I’m flattered~
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): and you sure know an awful lot about the war back then, for a fisherman, at least.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), turning around: well, I..
(She sees [Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) and freezes)
(Her eyes drift naturally towards her chest)
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): my eyes are up here.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): a-ack, sorry.
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): Right. Well, I suppose you’ve caused enough of a commotion in this household.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): r-right. I need to work! Se-see you later, Cherry!
Cherry: huh? Aww.. 
(Silence as Honey leaves)
Cherry: Dad!! You’re so annoying!! You wanna talk about war laws? Honey lived through them. You read about them on conspiracy forums!! 
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): Yeah?
Cherry: Yeah! 
(Cherry doesn’t really know about Honey’s past) 
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): where did you say she worked again?
Cherry: umm.. (hands her a business card).
([Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) raises an eyebrow) 
Soldiers have a special punctuation quirk to identify themselves as soldiers amongst other soldiers. It’s mostly used for passing secret notes around. The notes are typically encrypted. Since everything a soldier writes must be with this particular quirk, (it looks like a random comma to the naked eye, but to the educated..) she’s just never grown out of it. 
([Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) realizes that it’s [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) handwriting)
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md):.. and where can I find this.. Iron Lantern (the name of the restaurant)?
Cherry: h-huh? But I thought you didn’t like Ha-Binh’s food..
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md): hmph.
([Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) just runs out, chasing after [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md))
—-
Cherry falls in love with [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), unaware of Honey’s past. Honey just assumes that Cherry is being nice to her. 
Once Cherry confesses, Honey almost has a breakdown and pretty violently tells Cherry that she knows nothing about who Honey is, and what she’s done. Cherry tries telling her that that’s okay, and she’s willing to forgive her. She jokingly throws in, “it’s not like you’re a national guardian or anything. Coz then my dad wouldda killed you! And [Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) probably would really like you more.” 
…
Anyway.
as Honey finally relents and allows Cherry to lean in for a kiss, Cherry is stabbed. she slumps into Honey’s chest.
[Dinh](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Dinh.md) stabbed Cherry, thinking it was Honey. It was dark.. easy mistake.
Honey goes a little bit apeshit and almost kills her.
## Cecelia and Diana
two twin girls, one pink and one purple. They follow around Myazaki to an obsessive extent. They’re like Mya’s little sisters, and take everything Mya says as law. Will defend Mya til the day they die. 
Diana is optimistic and trigger happy. Despite being a nurse, she carries a pistol with her at all times. She smiles in even the strangest situations, and finds herself giggling at almost everything. She likes to joke around with her patients and say, “uh oh! This parts infected! We’ll cut it out~ Diana, please give me the chainsaw!” 
Cecelia is the more level-headed one. The compassionate, though quieter girl of the twins. She still remains optimistic but is a lot gentler with what she does. She caries around a sniper rifle with her, also despite being a nurse. She’s incredibly obsessive over Mya even to the point of deterring Diana from approaching Mya too much. Cecelia frankly doesn’t care, and is just happy to have something to do.
Myazaki
a brute-force sort of girl. Similarly to [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), she was a war veteran, but turned into a nurse. Or, she’s trying to. She’s very strict and stern, like an old traditional woman. She has a harsh glare and generally scares everyone away when she approaches them. Looks like an absolute punk. Incredibly muscular, but does her best to be gentle. However, she usually ends up destroying it anyway.  Mya was initially weary of Cecelia and Diana, but since they were both nurses, she decided to keep them around to hopefully ease everyone’s worries about her. Rumors only spread about Mya, and she’s.. incredibly depressed about them.
I had an idea where Myazaki left for a single afternoon to go get food in another city. Cecelia and Diana are freaking the FUCK out when they catch [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) in the distance beating the shit out of some clankers (sorry). And theyre like “HOLY SHIT !!! SHES PERFECT!!” And start to swarm [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) and ask if they could acompany her. I jsut thought it would be really funny to have [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) of ALL PEOPLE be off put by something .
Insert quest content here.

e if they saw Mya and were like “OH MY GOD MYA WE THOUGHT YOU DIED” and latch off of [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) and back onto Mya sobbing and crying. And Mya is exasperated and like “… I just got take out.”
And Cecelia and Diana just leave [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) forever alone, but you can at least get a discount whenver you travel to their area in game.



## Swamp King III
The tl;dr for this side quest goes as follows: 

[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) and [Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) are paddle boarding and hunting for fish
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): haha, if you're not careful, the merfolk will kidnap you!
[Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md): wh-what?
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): They live in pools like this.. and they'll EAT YOU!!! (cackle)
[Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md): i'm 23, Honey.
[Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md): keh. you're no fun. Can you hand me that--?
...
const is gone .....

Honey scans the water. all mineral oil? no wonder there was no fish! But where are they?..

Honey jumps in to find [Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md): and finds a full underwater society. She also finds [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) trying to fix her hair. Like they're both swept into a whirlpool and "what the hell are you doing here??", soaked and dripping in a humid sewer system. 
I imagine it like . the mermaid society in the mlp movie LOL. 
[Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) is swept in completely separately. Like she has no idea why honey is there. 

“Bleghhhghghh—[Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md)???”
“I can't work under these conditions. WAIT WHAT THE FUCK”

Anyway they go around to go find [Constantine](/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md):. Turns out, because of his mask they thought he was a cyborg and they were gonna scrap him for parts. 

[Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) were actually on a cleaning job together, and [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) looked away for a bit, and [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) fell into a whirlpool. So [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) is probably super pissed. 
Anyway the society is kind of like.. weird. Weird criminals who live under the plates of the ground, but not a part of the real underground society. More black-market-y than the normal black market. Sorta like dogtown from cyberpunk. 

Anyway I dunno what happens in the middle, but eventually after a huge fight, it ends with a gunshot coming from the corner… [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)/!!??!? she runs at [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md) with a knife and is like “I HAD TO CLEAN THAT WHOLE POOL BY MYSLEF!!!!” 
And she was so angry she even worked with the local police to go find [Nea](/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md). But they ended up taking down a huge crime ring that lived in the sewers. 

Not associated with the normal swamp king side quest.

## General single int
* Loveless’s wife quest
* This weird kid keeps bothering everyone and complains that there’s an alien abduction happening. If you go to the area at that time, there actualy IS an alien abduction and you have to kill every single one of them   
* NPC friend says "someone wanted this ring, but I cant deliver it myself. Can you?" And then when you turn around it gets stolen so you need to make a new one
* Alternatively you could track down the robber. It's just the NPC who says "I changed my mind". After you stab him, he just dusts himself off and walks away
* So when youre tracking down Vee (the villain for the intro), a suspicious mafia boss says he'll give you information if you pay him 1 USD. You give him one USD and he says "Kay, next, you need to steal the cash register from the local department store and then I'll give it to you." And so you do that and you find him shot dead so you just take the cash register and get a lot of money. He has a treasure chest in his hands which may or may not be real (its not)
* A band leader named Billiam Smakespar lost his most important possession- his cyborg singer! "Okay so I was out partying and I lost her power source, can you find it?I'll mark the area on your map for you!"
* A restaurant wants you to kill all of the people leaving bad reviews on their store
* A local department store wants you to play security and kick out any bad customers for a higher rating. The 'bad customers' in question are people who have comically large weaponry. There is an exception. He is a penguin. " i was going to bring this pack of fish to my daughter. but you stabbed me. who will feed my daughter now? "
* The sewers have mutant rats which run around the city. They’re mean to deal with so if you just go to the sewers and kill the queen, they stop attacking you. You also get the rats head as a medal
* I had a side quest for [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) since she does mercenary work wgeee one of her weird ex's hired her, initially to kill some ppl, but it turned out he just wanted to have a final date with her
