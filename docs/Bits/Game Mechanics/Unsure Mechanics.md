*These are the mechanics that I am still unsure whether to add or not.*

  # Buffs and Debuffs
### Buffs
Awaken
	`Base attack + 5% for 5 sec (stackable, but removed when the timer runs out), and regenerate a small amount of health passively.`

Enrage
	`Guaranteed crit for the next 3 hits (stackable)`

Regeneration
	`Regenerate 1% health for five seconds. Stackable up to 5% per second.`
Armor
	`Physical damage taken is reduced by 25%. Unstackable and caps out at five seconds.`

Infusion
	`The next hit is guaranteed to have a magic sting to it. Can be activated by magic characters.`

### Debuffs


Bleed
	`Lose 1% health per second for 3 seconds. Stackable up to 3%. Every time you dash, you lose an extra 1%.`

Stun
	`Self-explanatory. Stun will last for 1.75 seconds.`

Tire
	`It slows the character down, and you cannot gain anything during its infliction period.`

Smog
	`Accuracy down -75%`
	
Silence
	`Magical Stun, unable to use magic for a period of time (15% of an attackers MG points)`

### Special Events
 Ravenous
	 `x`
Ventriloquist
	`All damage is increased by 1/2, but you dont take it— your teammate does! They will not be really happy about it.`

Sugar High
	`Character has an unlimited amount of MP for a period of time, does not gain AD during this time. They will also receive a -50% remaining HP debuff when it stops.`


#### Church Modes

*Inside of dungeons, you can choose to get (You can’t choose it forces you to) get a Mode.*

*A church mode in music is like Ionian Dorian Phrygian Lydian Mixolydian etc. It just changes the notes in the scale.*

*EX: Dorian scale flattens the **3rd** and **7th** note in whatever scale. So Bb Dorian just means the Third and Seventh note in Bb are flat, so:*
	Bb, C, ***Db***, Eb, F, G, ***Ab***, Bb (Dorian)

*As opposed to:*
	Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb. (Ionian | Base)

So, in CORE, each number on the scale is assigned to a stat.

```
1 - ADCH

2 - ADRES

3 - Attack

4 - MGATK

5 - Defense

6 - MGDEF

7 - CRITRATE/HP

8 - CRITDMG

the more debuffs, the better the buff.
```
