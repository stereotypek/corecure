## Backstory

Made alongside [Prodigal](Prodigal.md). 

When [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) created her, she mutated. [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) was disgusted, and muttered, “She’s mutilated.” That became her name.

Mutilation has an obsession with [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) as her motherly figure. [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) keeps her away, but Mutation knows almost all of her secrets because she’s so nosy (including all of her clones and dirty secrets), so [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) is forced to spoil her. 

She’s gained immortality and doesn’t age. She steals body parts from soldiers she likes and places them inside of hers. Obviously some parts are already misplaced (the eye, mouth, etc were in that place at conception) so she has to put them there. She has [Khan](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md)’s leg and [Chou](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s eye as of right now.

She attempted to take [Honeycakes](../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) (or as she knew him, OMEGA)’s leg when [Khan](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Khan.md)’s got old and rotted, but they struck up a deal instead and OMEGA provided her with lots of other people for her to take instead of his.

mutilation has an obsession with being a mother, which was by proxy of [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) when [Nea](../Playable Characters/Nea.md) was conceived. However her view of ‘motherhood’ is from [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md)— not the best example. She witnessed everything [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) went through and was mostly just chewing her nails and watching excitedly, not understanding what was happening. She just understood that since [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) was doing it, it must mean that it was good. Her understanding of ‘motherhood’ is more ‘abusive wife’. She enjoys submissive men, specifically soldiers.

She has boned with [Honeycakes](../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) but [Honeycakes](../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) remembers her as the freakiest, most sadistic bitch ever who was laughing uncontrollably the entire time and drooling everywhere and screaming and sobbing, so he isn’t really interested in doing anything with her.

Mutilation was created when [Prodigal](Prodigal.md) was, so [Prodigal](Prodigal.md) is quite old by affiliation.

This was when [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) came into power

## FUN FACTS

Herod makes noise by sloshing her organs around since he has no vocal chords

Mutilation herself makes noise by complex technology. She commissioned an unknown scientist to have her vocal cords make noise through a radio instead of through a real mouth (since it’s in her chest). She loved him so much that she cannibalised him. Lol.

## Conversations

(Laying down) “ahah. Hello, Herod. I’m sorry to keep you in so long. Take a seat, Omega.” (M)

“…” (takes a seat) (O)

“No boys like me. You know why?”  (M)

“Y-you’re a.. you’re that .. that thing!”(O)

“Thing? How rude.” (M)

“Th.. then your mouth, is..?”(O)

(Rips off mouth to reveal it was sheet piece of LED and a radio) “that’s Herod. He’s my real body.”

“…”(O)

“Yes, yes.. well, you seem unaffected. That’s why I always go for soldiers. They’ve seen much, much worse.” (M)

“… your eye,”(O)

“Yes? You like it, don’t you? I’d give it to you, but.. well, yours are rarer. So be happy I dont take those~”  (M)

(.. Chou…) (O)

“The last man I met was Khan... didn’t care how disfigured I looked. Didn’t matter how much I took out of him. He just wanted me.. Oh, I’ve never felt so flattered since Pyrrhon created me..~” (M)

“K-Khan..?! You mean, that old hag? The one who died, like twenty years ago?!” (O)

“Hm? Oh, I…” (lie) “I met him, during his last days..~”  (M)

(Aware) “.. I see.”(O)

“I’ve never found another man so eager. Then you came along. You don’t care what I look like, do you?” (M)

“…”(O)

(Strokes little hair piece) “… hm~ I like this. You should keep it growing. I hear that it’s quite popular among young troops.” (M)

“… (blush).”(O)

“Now, shall we begin?” (M)

“But, I-…”(O)

“Getting cold feet? (Sigh) how silly. But now that you’ve seen me, I might have to kill you.”  (M)

“Don’t get ahead of yourself.”(O)

“Ho, ho? You’re strong. A really strong man..~ why don’t you come here? I’ll show you a really good night.” (M)

## Side Quest

Honey: I saved both of your pathetic lives. You’re coming with me.

Gamma: it’s … it’s 3 in the morning..?

Honey: I’m here to beat morning traffic, not listen to you complain. Get moving. Nea, you come too.

Gamma: she’s passed out. She won’t wake up.

Honey: is that so? Well, load her up. Make sure she doesn’t run, so tie her up.

Gamma: wh-what if she wakes up..?!

Honey: she’ll be fine. I won’t let anything happen to her.

Gamma: ..

Honey: You want to be a real clone soldier? Then listen to me. I’m your superior. Let’s get moving.

Gamma: tch.

Honey’s goal: get [Chou](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s eye

Why? It has [Chou](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Chou.md)’s DNA— *her* DNA. 

Why? She just wants to have it.

Now, Mutilation is extremely strong and quite literally revives herself. She’s rich and lives deep, deep in the mountain. She has guards and everything.

Gamma: how did you even meet her..!?

Honey: Like me, she’s a high up. You’re a soldier, act like it.

Gamma: Y-.. yes ma’am!

Honey’s a bit suicidal which is why she made this plan up in the first place. But she’s tired of Mutiliation’s very existence, so she brings in Nea. 

She discovered that Nea has a directly opposite blood type to Mutilation, AND Marian’s CORE. Since Marian’s CORE is covered with Nea’s blood and is a newer CORE update, she will explode internally. 

So when Mutilation's CORE comes in contact with Marian’s CORE, it will attempt to auto-update to absorb Marian's CORE. However, since her CORE is a custom job, the CORE realizes that a lot of checksums are missing and then realizes that something is wrong. Since it realizes that it has been tampered with, it will corrode instantly, killing Mutilation instantly, since it will kill her before she’s able to revive herself.

with Mutilation:

“.. you haven’t aged a day.”(H)

“Ah? Hmm.. I see you’ve heeded my advice” (strokes Honey’s hair). “You look so beautiful like that. (Begins to feel around Honeycakes) and.. what’s this?”

“…”(H)

“A sex change? Well, not to worry. I don’t care. Science can do many things, including me. Hahahah.”

“I brought what you wanted.”(H)

“Hm?”

“Marian’s daughter. The lover of… your lover.”(H)

“wh-what?!”(G)

“Wheel her in.” (H)

“That-.. wasn’t part of our plan!” (G)

“That’s right. It’s part of mine.”(H)

“You.. you traitor!” (G)

“Don’t forget your place. You work under me.”(H)

“… (fidgeting)”(G)

“And your eye?”(H)

“Hm? Oh, yes…” (flicks up hair) “it’s gorgeous, isn’t it? It’s fresh, too. Shame I have to give it away.”

“I don’t want that one. I want the other one.”

“Uh? The one from that little girl?”

“Chou.”

“Ah, yes.. I remember. Your mother..~ a real cute one, she was. I loved her, so much..~ she barely lasted. Barely lasted..”

“Here.” (Tosses sandwich) “they’re mantises.”

“Ah!~ you remembered? Awww, Herod says he loves you~”

(Incomprehensible noises from Herod)

“…”

Herod sinks its teeth into Nea’s shoulder, as Honey instructs. That is where [Honeycakes](../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) planted a bit of [Nea](../Playable Characters/Nea.md)’s core, so Herod recoils and begins to melt and corrode. However she put too little and Mutilation catches onto the plan and attacks them.

.. only she doesn’t.

Mutilation pins down [Nea](../Playable Characters/Nea.md) as she groggily begins to wake up and gets really freaky.

“I know ou. I know you! I KNOW YOU!!! I KNOW YOU!!! Mother , youre my father my father my father MY FAHTER!! YOURE MY FAHTER.. “

She thinks that [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) is her father, and since it’s [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE..

[Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) isn’t her father, she was just [Pyrrhon](Pyrrhon.md) ’s ‘’lover’’

Anyway the vicinity between Mutilation and [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)’s CORE kinda fucks things up and [Nea](../Playable Characters/Nea.md) goes into a deep, deep digital flashback. so does Mutilation

It lasts a second for [Gamma](../Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and [Honeycakes](../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md).

But in there, [Nea](../Playable Characters/Nea.md) basically is attacked by [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) (mutilation). She stabs him, and Mutilation says, “you’ve done so well..”

She gets flashbacks to when [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md) offered her his CORE. The sensation is so intense that it disrupts the connection and backfires on Mutilation, killing her instnatly.

Nea wakes up seeing Honey hanging up Mutilation like a slab of meat and sifting through the organs she wants to keep. She has Han cool them for her in a portable cooler.

Gamma is mostly making sure Nea is okay

Honey: … Alright. That’s about 10k Danari.

Gamma: wh-.. WHAT??? NO ONE IS WORTH THAT MUCH!!!

Honey: look at these organs. They’re branded. Don’t you see the variety? You scan them yourself. They’re soldiers— good soldiers. And these are in good shape.

Gamma: you know, if you wanted to sell organs, you could’ve just became a Merc!

Honey: hah. No, it was just this one time. I just wanted to get *one*, but.. 10k Danari is a nice farewell gift from her.❤️ 

She plucks out Chou’s eye and places it into a jar. 

Honey: there we are.

Gamma: the hell is that?

Honey: It’s your mother’s eye. It’s Chou’s eye.

Gamma: …!

Honey: obviously Chou is dead. I don’t intend on reviving her. Think of these as, “her ashes”.

Gamma: wh-.. what did you plan to do with them?

Honey: look at it.

Gamma: …?

Honey: did you think I was going to clone her? I have a business to run. I just wanted to look at her.

Gamma: that’s why you risked NEA’S LIFE??!

Honey: well, look. She’s alive, isn’t she? And she killed Mutilation. 

Honey: don’t worry. You both can keep 10 thousand D each. I already counted our shares. Han! Load up the cart, we’re going to Ritas!
