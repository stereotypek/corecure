*“…”*

Prodigal’s one of the gen2 clones along with [Mutilation](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md) and a few others. She is [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)’s best friend and a later boss in arc 1. Before she re-encountered Gamma, she lived with [07 ANGEL](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/07 ANGEL.md) and stole food from [Honeycakes](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md).
