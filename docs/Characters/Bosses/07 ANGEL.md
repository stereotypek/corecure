07 Angel is an escaped clone from generation 4. She takes great inspiration from [Characters/Bosses/Prodigal](/Characters/Bosses/Prodigal.md) and [Omega](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md) to escape to Earth.
As of right now, she is the ringleader of the [Arena](/Bits/Game Mechanics/Arena.md) and such the final boss in it.
Also just so happens to be a [fixer](Fixers .md) simply because of her establishment and also because, sometimes you can’t get all of the work done yourself. She’s very unreliable, but pays a lot for difficult jobs.
## Personality
A cold-hearted mercenary who works for herself exclusively. She’s a woman of very few words and mostly communicates by glowering down at people and/or extreme measures of violence.
She’s 13 years of age and has a hate-hate relationship with everything which Is and has been existing. She’s very stubborn and refuses to listen to anyone else. That is mostly because other people are too scared to talk to her. Greatly overestimates herself, but for good reason.

## Relationship with Prodigal
She was the one who saved Prodigal’s life, and thus revived her, causing [Prodigal 1](Prodigal 1.md) to go on her [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)-obsessed rampage. 07 Angel is indifferent to [Characters/Bosses/Prodigal](/Characters/Bosses/Prodigal.md) entirely, but provides her with a place to stay since [Characters/Bosses/Prodigal](/Characters/Bosses/Prodigal.md) is a great bouncer sometimes. 
Upon discovering [Characters/Bosses/Prodigal](/Characters/Bosses/Prodigal.md)’s death (and thus no bouncer), she challenged [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) to a duel to avenge her. Whether or not she's doing this because she likes Prodigal is unknown. When [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) won, she just spat on the ground and left. 
her death will also initiate the [Arena](/Bits/Game Mechanics/Arena.md) (wow this cool new club just opened..)

## Relationship With every other clone except Gamma
Leaning towards positive or neutral. The only clone she hates is [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md). since [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is [Omega](/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md), she’s top of the chart. Otherwise, [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) would be in the positive-neutral category.
She shows a lot more mercy towards other clones. Biological beings are fucked over almost instantly. She treats them the same with little words, but at least won’t try to slit their throats and will at least attempt to listen to them for more than 4 seconds. 
Because [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) caused 07 Angel to lose her best employee, 07 Angel has a vow to kill Gamma. She said that she would do it after she defeats Pyrrhon. Whether or not 07 Angel is like this because she liked Prodigal is unknown.

## Weaponry
She fights with four small, pink daggers which she controls at her will. At the beginning, she will use two (in her hand). On her second phase of fighting or when you encounter her in an intense difficulty, she will start off with four of her daggers (two of which hover in the air and shoot at you from a distance).
Like [Gamma](/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md), she’s hideously fast, but not *as* fast. She also has a great deal more magic and range than Gamma does, and certainly has the potential to win in a match against [Honeycakes](/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), if she didn’t admire her so much.
