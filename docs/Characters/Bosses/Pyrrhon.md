*”Let’s see what your pitiful hope looks like under 8 trillion Kelvin.”*
the primary antagonist of CORE. The current world leader.

## Personality

A bit of a maniac, if it wasn’t obvious. 

A well put together public figure.

Not much is known about her.

Nobody’s even *seen* her in years. 

Pyrrhon is more of an entity than anything. 

Do you think that the ghost in her shell is still there?

## Backstory

Pyrrhon, as a child, was relatively ignored. Her real name is unknown

She had three older brothers and two parents. Two older brothers have moved to get higher education, but the third stayed in the nearby area since he got accepted into the aerospace industry.

Pyrrhon, initially, wasn't super great at school, but her brother took her into his aerospace workplace and she tell in love. She got insane results and actually graduated college early to get that job with him.

(Her parents neglected her a lot. No matter what she did, she couldn't do it).

So after about a year, they plan to send her brother to space, since he's very physically active and good at this stuff.

That day was November 10, 203 BFC.

God's CORE fell to the ground and intercepted her brother. He died as God came down from heaven.

All that was left was the CORE, which had landed right in her hands.

So she got to work, and built her empire.

Her parents took credit for her work, so she killed them and used them for experimentation. It's the first time she realized that she has that power, and then, discovered the work of early human eugenics, and, with the CORE, set out to create the perfect society to erase all pain.

## GOAL 

Pyrrhon has seen wars. Pyrrhon has lived the wars, Pyrrhon has *been* the war. 

She inevitably determines, after lots of mediating, *why* wars occur: 

differences. 

racial wars, wars of differing view points, wars because someone thinks they deserve more land than the other..

Humans as a sheer concept are corrupt, in her eyes. all except for her. If everyone could just think just like her..

If everyone was a clone, a *perfect* being— a genetically *perfect* being, then wars should not begin.

So Pyrrhon began to create CLONES. Corrupted at first, but eventually became entirely self sufficient, and more importantly, living in her own image. 

Her end goal is to perfect an army of clones, use Kei and FUTURE (basically the death star), destroy earth, and rebuild it in her perfect image.

“You’ve been created in my image, whether you like it or not.”

“Stand down, or I will do it myself.” 

“Of course you’re perfect. I created you.”
