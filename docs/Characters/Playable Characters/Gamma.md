*”It’s just you, me, and the end of the world, Nea!”*
## Personality

Gamma’s this sorta hyperactive, one extreme to the next, all or nothing sort of thinker. Not so insane as everyone else, surprisingly, and has the most amount of compassion for other people than anyone else. On the outside, like at work, she’s this crazy trigger happy mercenary who kills as she pleases. She completely disregards her own health and defenses, which make a lot of people think she is suicidal. She takes great joy in innards in general, but she’s at least very good at her job. 

But surprisingly, she’d do anything for her friends. She’s quite gullible and brash and loves like a dog— complete and unconditional love. She’s extremely quickly paced and switches very drastically between her emotions, but still prioritizes everyone else above herself. I’m sure you know where this goes.

This actually stresses her out greatly and she has essentially trained herself to enjoy the pain which is how she gets out her stress— gore. Gore gore and more gore. Gamma will fight until the day she dies. In fact, that’s how she hopes to go out. As an explosion, rather than a long drawn-out flame.

## Backstory

Gamma was born into a 16-year-old-female-titanium skeleton within generation 3 ( even though [Honeycakes](Honeycakes.md) remains to be ~10 years older than her), and is the second youngest clone in that generation outside of [Epsilon](../NPCs/Other clones/Epsilon.md). She was born prematurely, but is still quite healthy.

She never particularly stood out when fighting for Pyrrhon, except until when she’d left FUTURE. Everyone else kind of ignored the newer g3 clones, and many (like [Phi](../NPCs/Other clones/Phi.md), [Chi](Chi.md), and [Muse](../NPCs/Other clones/Muse.md)) didn’t even know that they existed. 

Because of her general.. being-ignored-thing, she was paired up with another Low-level clone— a cranky old gen-2, half-working piece of scrap metal named [Prodigal](../Bosses/Prodigal.md).  Over Gamma’s lifetime (from years 8-17) she grew extremely close to [Prodigal](../Bosses/Prodigal.md), almost to the point of an obsession. [Prodigal](../Bosses/Prodigal.md) could have quite honestly cared less. Anyway, one day, Prodigal came up with a full map of FUTURE which had been dropped off of an abandoned hard-drive while she was dumpster diving. 

They began hatching a plan, a plan no one had thought of before: to get out of FUTURE once and for all. From 6 months of planning came the great escape from FUTURE. Their life, right in their hands, so close— 

As Gamma clung onto the hatch at the ceiling, Prodigal so close— 

BAM!!

Gamma made it out alive.

Prodigal did not.

The last thing Gamma saw was the eyes of Pyrrhon, and nothing else, as she crashed into Earth’s surface.

For some odd reason, Gamma couldn’t remember Prodigal’s face when she landed. Nor Prodigal as a concept. 

Where was she?

Gamma was saved by [Constantine](Constantine.md), a lone compsci nerd with nothing else to do but cut himself and weep. From that, she built her career of independent hitman work and bodyguarding and whatnot. 

There’s something still that itches her though, and it’s the strange, black, gooey figure who appears in the corner of her vision sometimes.

## Misc

**Mercenary History**
Gamma’s a *merc*, or a mercenary, who does paid work. Despite only being on Earth for such a short period of time, she’s made quite the name for herself! But how..?!

*Gamma actually got her ‘big break’ by being scammed.* Soon after she left Constantine’s town, she went a bit money crazy and blew her money on dumb shit. just Kidding she wanted cybernetic implants— or at least, ones that wouldn’t identify her as a clone so easily. She found one for an exceedingly good deal— a new charging port, which was almost seamless in her body. You could barely even tell it was there! It barely needed to be oiled and everything! And she didnt sleep on her side, so it’s perfect!
narrator: it was not perfect

Gamma soon found herself in a tub of ice, completely naked, with her clothes torn up and weapons gone.

She’d been kidnapped! They weren’t going to *give* her Cyberwear, they were going to *take hers!*

Gamma doesn’t remember much of the incident, or at least that’s what she says. But [Rita](../NPCs/Various NPCs/Rita.md) does.

The first thing that Rita saw was a blood and gut covered ceiling, with weapons and scalpels turned everywhere, and a suspiciously naked little girl in the middle of it. 

She’d killed all of the scavengers— and lived to tell the tale. admittedly, Rita’s first thought was not ‘is she okay’ but ‘wow i shoudl hire her!’. And that’s what she did.

Gamma’s been working peacefully with [Rita](../NPCs/Various NPCs/Rita.md), [Moanama](../NPCs/Various NPCs/Moanama.md), and the other [Fixers](../NPCs/Functional NPCs/Fixers.md) peacefully ever since.

# Items

**The Comet**
> Gamma’s trusty motorcycle! Crafted of Beryllium and carbon fiber, it’s a lightweight and air-powered monster. It’s small and already barely fits Gamma, but if she really tries, she can put two people. It floats in the air via fans rather than using wheels on the ground. It’s very compact, since she needed to hide it a lot. It’s extremely fast, but it can be destroyed easily. She’s always tending to its repairs. 

**Metallic Fists of Unknown Origin**
> She has no idea where they came from or why she has them, but they’re her strongest (and only) means of defense. With strong electricity conducting properties and a small gun in each, it serves as a lightweight yet heavy hitting weapon.

# Gameplay

*Gamma's play style is very heavily inspired by [Akane](https://youtu.be/rvnPUK1tWWs?si=4bh3RHIZLUZOMaP4)* 

**Role**: Glass cannon.
> Essentially, character that can deal a lot of destruction, but is highly vulnerable to attacks. Hence a “cannon”, because they're so powerful, and “glass” because they're fragile, if struck. Gamma’s fast to make up for it— fast enough to outrun her enemies— if you know how to use her correctly.


**Signature Ability**: SuperSonix
> 	She can dash through enemies and projectiles without taking damage (basically she evades attack when dashing) BUT it has a 3 second cooldown. she will also damage anything within the radius of her dash.`

> 	Basically with this you can go behind enemies and attack them from behind. Each upgrade will add another benefit to her damage

**Extended Ability**: Adrenaline Junkie
> 	For each enemy killed within 3 seconds of each other, gain +1 stack of **Epinephrine**. Each stack of **Epinephrine** grants +5% ATK spd and MOV spd. 

> 	For each 1.5 second with no damage dealt, loose a stack of **Epinephrine**. 

> 	When activating SHIFT, consume all stacks of **Epinephrine** to release a shockwave which knocks enemies back.

**Base**: Fists
> 	Bare bones fist attacks! She has two quick jabs, then a final upswing, which she can then use to attack them again or use an item. The upswing will gain some magic damage on occasion.

> 		there is a way to anim cancel the third attack to get

> 			- 2 jab

> 			- Supersonix (get behind the enemy)

> 			- full 3-hit combo

> 			- Gun attack

> 			Which will result in launching the enemy quite far.

**Shift**: Gunning 
> 	When pressing SHIFT, Gamma can consume some MP to shoot bullets in the direction of wherever the mouse is. She can shoot quite a bit of bullets before she runs out of MP (And it regenerates over time, anyway). However, their range is limited and she remains stationary during this time.


**ULTIMATE**: SLAUGHTERHOUSE
>	Goes off of HP. Your health decreases by 1% + base ATK*.25 / 100`

	Time stops, leaving behind a neon trail so it gets hard to see after a while. When finished, she takes a little burst of damage.

	For each enemy killed, she gains +1% health. This number increases if she kills a lot in a combo (ie 10 enemies -> 2%…). If she dies in this state, Gamma will explode! Will instantly kill any enemy below 60% health and below miniboss status (bosses get cut down to 250% of her ATK).

“Patch notes”

Old ability: - Gamma has a small chance on hit to gain thorns on hit (the chance increases depending on how powerful the incoming attack is), which reflects 100% of damage, but only lasts for 1 hit suffered. He takes 50% reduced damage from it. Stackable and upgradable (chance up to receive it)

- Passive
- + 25% extra damage with projectiles.
