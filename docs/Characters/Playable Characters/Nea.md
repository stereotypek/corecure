This note is UNFINISHED. Lived in [Sosolensk](../../Locations/Sosolensk.md)

daughter of [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md)

## Personality

_Nea, overall, is an egotistical brat. Yes, she’s smart enough to back that up, but she thinks awfully highly of herself. She’s horribly selfish, she only works for herself, and herself only. No one needs to know more about her. With that, she’s stoic and cold and would barely respond to you. She’s got a slender and tall build, with a hefty ponytail which could blanket a small child._

_Nea’s a feisty little thing. She’s aggressive and passionate, but tries not to let it slip out to preserve her image. She can be extremely rude, but sometimes she isn’t aware of it, so you’ll just have to tell her directly. She tries not to show any emotion, but she isn’t great at it. She comes across as more of a “Tsundere” than a cold and serious person once you get to know her. She’s pretty intimidating and likes to stay organized and on-top of things. She’s a perfectionist to a fault._

_Psychotically smart, Nea’s got some pretty fucked up ideas and thoughts in her head.

## Backstory

Nea’s origins are unknown to her. She woke up in a temple and grew up in a temple. One of the first students of [General Worldbuilding](../../Bits/Worldbuilding/General Worldbuilding.md), she grew as an exceptional musician and an expert at manipulating magic to her will. Age 18 was the day to take over her father.

She doesn’t really like her father. Cold and stoic and harsh, that’s all. No loving relationship whatsoever, barely even a father.

And God knows what sort of mother she might’ve had should she had lived.

At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power.

Nea could really care less.

Until she walks into her room and sees her father’s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman?

“My daughter,” [ she](Pyrrhon.md) says to Nea. “I found you.”

”I am not your daughter.”

Her father coughs up blood. [Marian](../NPCs/Lore Characters/Marian.md), renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal.

Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart.

Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions.

Nea looks up at Pyrrhon.

Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter.

Nea’s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon’s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon’s smart. Why else is she a world leader?

Her father lays motionless.

Pyrrhon only grins.

All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames.

She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames.

She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing.

Five years later, no one knows it was her. Not that many people knew that temples still existed, anyway. Much less that one burned down in the middle of nowhere. She attends schools and colleges, since what else could you do? But slave away her magic for a machine which rejected the very idea of her? Nea only bites her teeth and steels herself. No point in fighting a losing battle.

That is, until a little clone named Gamma stole something particularly important to her.

## Relationship with...

Marian

She despises him. She believes him to be the root cause of every single one of her issues. And she isn’t very wrong about that.

When Nea was four years old, Marian met her for the first time. He had such an immense breakdown, he almost killed Nea at the altar and sacrificed her. He was stopped by the temple guards.

When Nea was six years old, Marian began to teach her how to sword fight. it entailed lots and lots of physical violence between them both.

At sixteen, Baluch (). 

Marian walked in right as Baluch did it and thrwe Baluch Out by the scruff of his neck.

He handed Nea some clothes without a word and instructed her to get changed.

Baluch ended up with such horrific wounds he was permanently paralyzed from the legs down. Marian was not kicked out, but he was severely demoted. 

i mean, they really hated each other. Marian saw her as an embodiment of Pyrrhon that he couldn’t escape. Nea saw him as an insufferable wife beater. 

They have had three civil conversations. One when she met Khan, one when Baluch assaulted her, and one at his suicide. 

She doesn’t understand him and frankly she isn’t very interested to do so.

Gamma

Gamma is an anomaly to her. Simultaneously the most human non-human she’s ever met. A weird amalgamation of morals mixed with bloodshed. 

Initially she was drawn to Gamma because of her odd morality, like an object to study. Also, because she didn’t have much of a choice at the time. But Gamma just intrigues her. And engineers are known for their undying curiosity

Constantine 

She has nothing to say about him. 

Honeycakes

A strained older-sister type relationship. 

Shenx

Shenx temporarily grew up in the same religious sect as she did, so they bond over that. Shenx is a bit bad with religious customs, but Nea helps him out. She’s also a great information broker for him, so he enjoys having her. She’s also a backup for Gamma

Shou

Shou respects Nea because Nea’s the only one to both leave her alone and put up with her bullshit. She doesnt like Nea, but she tolerates her. Which is a lot better than most

Khan

She hates him more Than anything. As the next embodiment of her father, he’s the one to stake the blame in his place. 

Rhaika-Lei

She thinks he’s a stuck up pompous bastard who deserves nothing that he’s “achieved”. 


## MISC

1. The Malleable Object.

    1. All that’s left of her father’s CORE is his hopes in dreams: in liquid form! It’s pink and glittery and shines dimly at normal levels. It’s malleable, which means she can form it into any object: but the more deadly the object, the more energy it takes for her to form it. She typically uses it as a shield.

        1. It is mainly used as a transportation device. She tends to sprint for short distances, but gets tired and ends up running the rest of the way. Imagine it like a hoverboard.

    2. The malleable object can break, but it will repair over time. When it does, however, it takes a very long time to heal, and Nea is basically helpless. She yells to Gamma or Honeycakes for help, since she can’t do much.

    3. The Malleable object can only form into things that Nea knows the ins and outs of from memory. Basically construction from memory.

        1. it can go into musical instruments, but she must provide the reed.

- Nea likes grapes and grape-flavored items.
- She likes graphing calculators a lot, she really wants one but has never bought one.
- Nea likes sparkling drinks of any time, especially spiked ones, but she’ll only drink it if it contains sugar of some kind
- She prefers suits over dresses.
- She really likes chocolate-flavored items, especially cakes.
- Despite her mainly playing her viola, she plays other instruments. Her other favorites include the oboe, double bass, and piano. She is practicing alto saxophone right now.
- Nea likes hardstyle techno, and phantom of the opera
- She and Balach were in a situationship a while back, so they’re particularly bitter against each other.
    - He overstepped her boundaries, but ONCE. Marian walked in and beat the living shit out of Balach. He took Nea out of the temple and sent her to school. It was the only time she saw him cry, even at his death.

- her birthday is November 13th. The rapture was Nov 10. She’s not the biggest fan.


Childhood

Nea as a child,,

She’s like, Really self-centered and quite manipulative, she used her looks and good reputation to gain attention from people around her to give her stuff. She bought a lot of stupid items. She was particularly good at love bombing and gaslighting She was okay at school, for a time. She had a small phase where she rebelled (they had the money to just stop..) and dropped out of school for a while to do random shit, like sports. But her dad forced her back in. Even as a kid, she was really loud. She didn’t cry but she wailed, and she wailed a lot. She was a stubborn little brat who always wanted her way. Quite literally no empathy for other people, she was one of THOSE popular kids. Nea was taken out of her last two years of middle school to do intensive temple training, which actually brought her back into shape and she became a little less spoiled. She became good at fighting and was now really educated in religion and everything because she literally worked her ASS off (out of complete spite, there was another girl she didn’t like in her program). Her dad congratulated her, which gave her the confidence to start trying in school. In high school, she was like twilight sparkle but more sociable. She was “popular”, but mostly because the popular kids there liked her because she’d let them cheat off her homework. She went to the same school Chasmus went to, fun fact. Anyway, she ended up getting a boyfriend. She thought that she could easily take advantage of his new money for her own advantage, but no! Nea actually got uh, into a very bad and toxic relationship! I mean, sure, she had “relationships” but none of those guys could really “handle her” (poor and she was really energetic and got too excited a lot). He kinda, like, used her for her body and turned all of her previous manipulation tactics against her, so she was in a terrible state until she was taken out AGAIN for more religious training, which she was pretty happy to do. So for three years, she didn’t step foot outside of her temple. She was in a pretty nasty mental state, and it’s not like her dad really helped her with that. Marian doesn’t know how to deal with kids so he’s kinda emotionally neglectful and lashes out at them a lot. He’s actually a little abusive, so Nea had a bad relationship with him. He also hated her because of what happened with Pyrrhon, but he was getting better slowly and was now (badly) trying to spark a relationship with her. However she rejected 99% of attempts (except one, which was near the end). So she mastered the art of Refined Magic, good job, Nea! By this time, she’d graduated high school solely off of religious exemption and now worked at her temple for one more year, until Pyrrhon invaded it, and then she burned the temple down,, Mostly because she had almost never suffered the consequences of her own actions before. Anything broken could always be replaced with her money, but her father is gone, and years of history is now ash, and Pyrrhon’s after her, and she’s completely useless now. She never talked about her religious background, but bought herself a fake identity after working a year or so in the underworld. She went to school for engineering and minored in music while working her side job in the underworld, But like, she got fired.. and like, she met Gamma.. and like, got kicked out of school because she’s rumored to be dead.. After Marian’s death she became really quiet and completely reconstructed herself as a being. She’s also really NARCISITIC STILL HONESTLY FUCKING LEARN!!! But she leans on the independent, “I’m better than you and you will taint me by your presence!”



## Playstyle

Role: Classic all rounder, self-sustainer

> 	While she has a pretty heavy lean into magic attacks, she’s quite slow compared to others. She’s a mid-ranged attacker who can dish out all kinds of attacks and heal herself. She’s more of a jack of all trades (with a heavy lean into her special attacks).



**Signature Ability**: RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE
>	*Each combo hit above 5 will add an increased +1% damage to the next hit. this stacks on top of other bonuses*

> 	ie

> 	6 hit: 101% dmg

> 	7 hits: 102% dmg (+2% of it's normal damage)

> 	8 hits: 103% dmg

> 	... etc. 

> 	This value resets once the combo ends

Extended Ability: Counterpoint! 

> 	If Nea is hit mid-swing by a PHYSICAL attack, then trigger a parry slash. Also, gain the ability to cancel an enemy attack once every 5 seconds.

**Base**: Swords Dance
>	Exactly what it sounds like! Nea does two quick slashes then a down swing.

**Shift**: Grace Notes
> 	All melee attacks gain +1 phantom hit at 50% damage (visually distinct, hits slightly after the main strike)

> 	These phantom hits count toward combo count and RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE bonus.

> 	All phantom hits deal magic damage.

> 	Parrying during Grace Notes automatically resets the cooldown of your next combo finisher, letting you loop offense faster. 

> 	HOWEVER Nea will eventually get bored and tired of this, so SHIFT can only last for about 12 seconds before she goes back. 20 second cooldown between each.

**ULTIMATE**: ())
> aaaa








 ”patch notes”:

Old ultimate: 

Passive regen for all teammates for the duration of her ult.

ULT - Martyr (if neutral is pressed).

Heals 25-75% of Nea’s missing HP to her teammates, but not her. She also provides shields for each new teammate which tags in, but weaker that Constantine.

ULT - Blood Drive (if special is pressed)

Every single attack deals like +3 hits of splash damage for a few seconds. Works particularly well with her CHAINING ability.

ULT- Rhaika-Lei reveals his third eye, which shoots two dragons out of his soul to attack all of the enemies within his line of sight in a straight line. It will freeze them and temporarily interrupt almost all attacks, except for those immune to interruptions.

- Applies the ‘inked’ debuff to the enemies, which essentially grants more damage dealt to them, the more that they are hit with the ink. Destroying the enemy will replenish all of the ink, and can be thrown again to the next enemy.

**Ability**: RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE
>	*Each combo hit above 5 will add an increased +1% damage to the next hit. this stacks on top of other bonuses*

> 	ie

> 	6 hit: 101% dmg

**Base**: Swords Dance
>	Exactly what it sounds like! Nea does two quick slashes then a down swing.

**Shift**: VOID AFINITY
> 	*By sacrificing* **10%** *of Nea's* **Max Health** *She will summon a small 'void'.*

> 	*Each 'void' will add one additional combo hit to each new combo. All damage caused by the 'voids' are considered as magic damage.*

> 	Basically 

> 	A normal combo is 4 hits for Nea

> 	+1 void = 5 hits

> 	+2 voids = 6 hits

> 	+3 voids = 7 hits

> 	+4 voids = 9 hits

> 	It caps out at 4 voids (-40% max health)

> 	*Additionally, when removing a void, restore 5% max health AND recover 5% of all damage caused*. 

> 	Howver, doing this will cause all voids to cease, and will leave Nea vulnurable for a period of time

ULTIMATE:
