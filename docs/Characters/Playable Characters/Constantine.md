*Not a clone, but not anything else either. Just a guy running from his student loans like everyone else.* Belongs to [Hà-Binh](CΓÖíRE/Locations/Hà-Binh.md)

“... Who are you, again?”

## Personality 
He’s like, *that* guy. 
Imagine the one with ADHD who says unhinged shit, but flourishes in things like art, animation, and movie analysis and likes Scott the Woz. He’s like that but for engineering and warships. His above all special interest is studying [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)’s COREs and learning about the past human civilization.
Constantine is pretty cautiously offensive. Passive aggressive. Heavy restraint. He’s generally timid and cautious, and extremely unathletic. kind of a NEET, a pathetic loser NEET. if if weren’t for [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md), he'd be executed via his student loans. 
He has pretty crippling anxiety with people who aren’t his very close friends. Otherwise he’s really sarcastic and kind of mean 
He's an alcoholic who relies on various drugs to keep himself awake and lively, so he likes [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md)
He's really only comfortable and openly mean in front of [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md), they're non-familial siblings. A loser, but a smart (and stubborn) loser. Oh, and Cassidy
His outside disguise before [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md) is as a mechanic. His personal workshop is a small stall wedged in-between two large buildings. He’s really good but not well known. He mostly only works for himself and his friends. He’s the main mechanic in [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md).
He has scars from a bad burning accident while his dad was fucking with chemicals. He's physically fine. But he's so ugly he wears a welding mask to cover it up.
## Backstory
Constantine was born into a little family in current-day Philipines, up in Bontoc. He lived in a small village, with very little access to technology except for things like fliphones and creaky computers. This is because it rains almost all the time, and most of the houses are made of tar, planks, leaves, metal sheets, etc. 
His parents never really let Constantine out of the house. It was against their religion to abort or abandon him, so they just locked him inside of the closet so he wouldn’t rat them out. They got tax benefits, and played it off as, ‘he’s very sick’. He was raised entirely online and by the internet, through chat rooms and such. He spent most of his time on (YouTube), scrolling on social media, involving himself in cheesy old forums, playing old games, etc. 
On one particularly bad night, Constantine was almost fatally injured by his father experimenting to make illegal drugs at home. He had walked in at bad times and ended up with awful chemical burns which left his face extremely disfigured and ugly. To cover them up, he wears a welding mask (he does actually know how to weld, since it’s what he does for a living.)
As he got older, he saw a few videos of people doing live surgeries on clones and other machines, and developed such a large hyperfixation for it, he’d actually managed to write and create a master guide for clone, CORE, and Pi-Bot mechanics, due to his extensive research and abundance of time. This was a revolutionary thing, since it’d never been compiled so easily for everyone. 
He also got a lot better at coding from this, and eventually got a few jobs (he’d illegally gotten into a few databases for his master list).
As Constantine grew older and more isolated, he built up his online reputation more and more. He works as a mechanic, but also as a blackmailer. his work partner is a girl named XETA, who has a huge crush on him but he’s gay. She was the one who knocked some sense into him about the ‘classic redditor views’ he had.
On another awful night of his, with his hands embedded with glass shards and tinted with blood, he walked out into his backyard with a gun, intending to end his life.
He saw a star in the distant night. Small at first, but then grew into a hideously large explosion right next to him. 
As the dust settled, he’d noticed a very small, delicate clone beneath him.
His first instinct was to dissect her, which was exactly what he did. There is a full, well-documented website about this. He did it live while taking great care not to reveal himself (which he kind of did well). He extracted all of the software inside of Gamma since she was intact. It’s rare since they’re usually destroyed on impact by default. He sold the data to some people on the internet, then got quite a bit of money.
After a few days of Gamma sitting there collecting dust, he decided to rebuild her (which wasn’t documented for some reason) and save her. 
He didn’t really know what to do with her, and mostly just sent her out to get him food from the outside. They eventually struck a deal which was essentially,
Since you saved my life, I’ll get you away from your parents, which Constantine accepted. From his fundings on the internet, he was sent to a school and got a license to be a mechanic/technician. Gamma left shortly after.
Constantine is actually in horrific debt due to that (he vastly underestimated the cost and kind of got scammed) and is currently evading taxes and running a ‘mechanic shop’ (dark web/blackmail business) to keep himself alive for longer. 

## Relationship with…
Relationship with Shenx
Constantine and [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md) have a pretty cooperative deal together. Constantine gives him information and [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md) provides him with basic needs. [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md) is essentially his boss and hires Constantine to get leads on gov officials. The rest of [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md)’s team, like [Sho](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Sho.md), do all of the physical work. 
it took a very, very long time for Constantine to warm up to [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md) since he has pretty crippling anxiety, but it did happen and they’re inseparable now.
People speculate if they are dating. Constantine pretty vehemently denies it. Shenx doesn’t seem to care.
Relationship with XETA
So people like to joke with Constantine saying that Xeta is his discord girlfriend. He likes to beat them back up. He's kind of scrawny so he just grumbles and leaves. He's a little gay twink (all compsci majors are).
Xeta does actually really like Constantine but keeps her distance because she respects him. You can meet Xeta in game! Since she helps Const with work a lot. Xeta donated some money for him to rent a studio apartment where he currently runs his work.
However, as Constantine took on more and more mercenary work, the less and less Xeta approved. It ended with a truce.
But, not all truces last that long.
Relationship with Clementine
Next to him is a small church. One of the altar boys is named Clementine. He also deals with general dark-ish web deals, but not to the extent Constantine does.
I think Constantine met Shenx when he was dealing with business. So he consequently met Clementine then.
Clementine met Shenx and shortly joined TLH after because he had intel in the church he was in which is CRAZY powerful.
So Clementine was there and Constantine and him didn't get along very well
People like to call Clementine "Constantine's evil twin" because they're just complete opposites and bash each other's heads in constantly.
Clementine is eh friends with Gamma. He's genuinely a huge piece of shit but they're civil to her.
They work really well together, as a fighting duo. And with Clementine, they're all really good together. Shenx uses a mech, Clementine uses a weird spear thing, and Constantine uses his computer (he shields and supports his team).
Shenx and Constantine's first major interaction was when they raided a huge party. They needed this piece of tech from a mansion and they both knew it was a suicide mission, but said "eh fuck it. Nah, l'd win!"
So they dressed up together. Const actualy had to dress up as a girl in order to get in so Clementine really enjoyed blackmailing him with that.
It's pretty heavily implied that Constantine and Shenx boned. Anyway Constantine just gets really shy around Shenx. People also theorize that about Shenx and Constantine Shenx is like the stereotypical bartender. thing? He's the guy with no legs if you remember him. He's just an overall sweet guy and Constantine really appreciates him. Actually so much that Constantine goes out of his way to give Shenx elaborate gifts as a thank you (shenx has started taking on Const's rent)
Relationship with Gamma
Constantine and [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) have a pretty ‘odd’ relationship. While still civil, they aren’t particularly close with each other. It’s more of a business relationship— Constantine does what he wants with her, and she helps him financially. Or so it seems
It gets 
A lot deeper than that though.
[Constantine and Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Constantine and Gamma.md)



He’s neutral about [Nea](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Nea.md). 
He is deeply scared of [Honeycakes](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md).

## Current Standings
As of about right now, Constantine’s job varies from blackmail, interceptions, hacking, etc. is Constantine a good person? No. Constantine dissected his now sister and sold her data to the dark web. Constantine actively ruins people’s lives by selling their private information. Constantine blackmails people. But he is aware of that. He’s aware he’s irredeemable (is he?), and I think that’s what makes him cool.
I wouldn’t say Constantine particularly enjoys being a part of the main story. He likes [Shenx](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Functional NPCs/Shenx.md), and he likes [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md). And he likes [TLH](CΓÖíRE/Locations/TLH.md), but he doesn’t really like.. everything else. He doesn’t want to be involved.

# Gameplay 


![IMG_4377.png](/img/user/C%CE%93%C3%96%C3%ADRE/Pictures/IMG_4377.png)


**Signature Ability**: *Technician*
> 	All items that Constantine uses get a boost to whatever their effect is (ie damage, debuff rate, healing percentage, buff duration, etc).
> 	At his final skill, Constantine is granted a 20% chance of ‘revivability’ Each time he uses an item. This basically means that whenever he uses an item, there’s a 20% chance it will reactivate at 50% of its original power, which then makes it to be 150% + whatever his bonus is.
> 	If the 20% roll fails, gain a frustration meter. When frustration is at max, the next buff is guaranteed at 200%.
> 	Certain equipment can guarantee that 20% always fails OR is always guaranteed.)

**Extended Ability**: Wormded Ability: WORM
> 	When pressing special attack while shooting, deploy a digital worm into an enemy’s neural system.
> 	Enemies afflicted with WORM suffer
> 	- -25% movement speed
> 	- -25% attack speed
> 	- +5% incoming damage  
	    (Note: The movement and attack speed debuffs do not stack.)
	If a WORM-afflicted enemy is killed or leaves the screen, the WORM transfers to the enemy with the highest ATK currently on-field. If multiple enemies share the highest ATK, it targets the nearest one to the dead enemy.
	If no valid enemies remain, the WORM returns to Constantine.
	WORMs last 15 seconds on a host. You may deploy a maximum of two.
	If both worms infect the same enemy, that enemy takes +15% extra damage, but ATK/MOV speed debuffs remain at -25%.


**Role**: Long Range Heavy Hitter
	Did you know that [Honeycakes](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md) is faster than this bastard? He wields a huge machine gun which weighs him down to the ground basically.

**Base**: Snuffr
> 	Constantine has this huge rifle. The bullet will despawn once hitting the edge of the camera, essentially giving you range to hit whatever is in your view. He is kind of stationary, and can move and air-dodge while aiming, but it doesn’t help.
> 	His Rifle can pierce through multiple enemies and can actually ricochet off of walls if it’s upgraded enough.

**Shift**: Thick Skin
> 	Constnatine, in true idiot fashion, will pull out his riot shield. He’ll swing it around, similarly to how Honey swings her hammer, but at a significantly faster rate. While they deal much less damage, he can do small combos and move around better. When guarding, all bullets are reflected and physical attacks have a small chance to stun the opponent. Also, gain significantly reduced defense. Successful parries gain additional ADRENALINE. Enemies killed while stunned have a +40% drop rate. Every 30 seconds, release an electric pulse (can be sent out on player input) to damage enemies.

“Patch notes” 
Old ability: 
Indomitable
• Constantine locks it in! Each critical hit which he deals regenerates 100% of the inflected damage as health to Constantine. This effectively cancels out any thorns effect. He already has a pretty high crit dmg and crit rate, but his base attack is extremely low.
• This will activate every time he lands 5 hits or more on a combo.
• Each mega shield summoned will grant permanent regen for the duration of it’s life.
• Passive
• None

Old ultimate: The Hospital Floor

• Constantine revives ALL teammates by 25% of their max health, and grants them all a destructibel shield once tagging in. He also throws down a small pool of golden liquid, which can heal anyone in the range of it, excluding enemies.

• If you press his special, he will revive all teammates by 100%, but then kill himself afterwards.
