This note is UNFINISHED. Lives in [Hà-Binh](CΓÖíRE/Locations/Hà-Binh.md)

*“I have nothing to lose. You, on the other hand? Everything. Now tell me what you know.”*

## Personality
_“Didn’t expect much from a corpse in the first place!”_



Honey’s weird. I’m weird. Like many of my characters, she’s a small expansion of me.
You look at Honeycakes, and she’s a bubbly and aggressive idiot. Like, _really_ stupid. She takes jokes too seriously, or they fly over her head. She finds the stupidest, goriest things hilarious. She’s upbeat and aloof and comfortable, without a single care in the world. No social awareness, just floating around above the rest.
She sees herself as an older-sister type to others. Can be serious if she really does try hard enough. Can care about people if she really wants to.. well, actually, Honeycakes cares a lot about things, like her job as well as current world politics. She’s extremely pessimistic and won’t hesitate to tear you to shreds, should you get too close. She’s aggressive to a psychotic fault, like a wild animal.
Honey’s surprisingly empathetic to other clones and is usually willing to give people a second chance, even the ones that she almost kills. She doesn’t really know how to get her point across other than pure and raw violence. She doubles down and is stubborn and hard-headed.


## Backstory

Honey doesn’t have much to her, so she says.  

Born in 3.0’s “humanitarian cloning program”, she was no 3 out of 9. The smaller the number, the older the body skeleton. Honey was born into the body of a 25-year-old male. He’s [Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md), he’s the world’s best clone.

Honey had the most of the PRODIGAL CORE inserted into him, giving him insane amounts of strength. With this, he was easily trusted and let into areas she shouldn’t be.

There’s a reason why they try to dampen the intellect of clones nowadays.  

Honey looks around, and sees nothing but a world of everything he’s ever hated. 

And he’s *sick of it*. 

One small fight into a small rebellion, now he’s chained up to the wall and tortured until she can barely breathe. Three days until execution.

Honey has one last look at her original form, her mother core.

Two days until execution.

Honey begins to ponder.

One day until execution.

Then, nothing at all.

No one, at least in the general public, knows what happened or where she went; All they know was that 3 PiBots were torn apart and that [Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md)— The *original war leader* Pyrrhon— was injured.

[Pyrrhon](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Bosses/Pyrrhon.md) said she wanted to be there when "[Omega](CΓÖíRE/Characters/NPCs/Various NPCs/Omega.md)'s futile resistance fell", and stood right in front of Honey taunting her. But Honey broke out and injured her. The laser was fired and Omega was nowhere to be found and is presumed dead.

No one had ever done that before.

And Honey…

She’s not Omega, she’s not a clone, and she’s not a 25-year-old-male skeleton.

She’s always felt comfortable as a girl, anyway.

*It's so hard to function*

*I feel like my body has died with my soul trapped inside*

*This cold death rattle in my chest feels just like pennies in a tin can*

*Sugar, I wonder how long you will wait for me*

*Or if you even thought to save the pieces of my shattered ego*

*These terrible chemical vapors are cutting up my lungs*

She spent two years in the mountains, meditating and dealing with various underground facilities and organizations. With Kit, Dinh, Adam, and a few others. Her skin changed color. She started to become *Honey*.

	However, due to an unfortunate argument between Python and Honeycakes, they both parted ways, mostly on Honey’s fault.

It has been 5 and a half years since that day. She’s got a job and a small group of friends and no history to her whatsoever.

Now, Honey lives as a fisherman and chef, staying late nights at a restaurant preparing raw meats and salads.

What a shame, for who else to show up at her front door, 5 years later, but the woman she almost killed?

## Relationships with...

## Misc
1. JUSTICE
    1. Honey’s trusty hammer! Heavy enough that almost no one can pick it up, except Honey. She picks it up with ease, one-handed, while it takes Gamma, Nea, _and_ Constantine to even lift it up 3 inches.
        1. Coated with leather and made with beryllium, it’s painted with brass and red, despite being diamond on the inside. On each end, one fire, one electric. Two fuel tanks, made of the two chemicals in bombdeber (?? ) beetles, so it can activate almost immediately. Sometimes she burns herself, so she has leather gloves.
        2. It’s personalized with small star stickers and cute ribbons. It has spikes on the rims.
    2. There’s not much to Justice, other that Honey stole it from an old man, found dead in his home. She paid her respects and everything, but that hammer was pretty sick. Wonder who that guy was..
        1. Beryllium has a very high heat capacity, so it can catch fire for a long time.
- She's good at preparing raw meat but ASS at cooking, so she's mostly hired to do preparations at the restaurant.
- She’s a great swimmer! She loves fish and she loves to eat them. She’ll prepare any meal for you!
- She likes dressing up fancy and she is really fucking hot in makeup, idfk why she's insanely good at it despite never attending a formal event.
- She exclusively eats meat, and nothing else. Which is funny, because her girlfriend is strictly vegetarian. Her favorite is raw fish.
- She likes pine trees and drinking sap.
- Her favorite holiday is St. Patrick's for no real reason, other than she thinks that the entire concept of “leprechauns” and “Irish people” is the most amusing thing in the world.
- Her favorite fruit is Jujube and she enjoys banana flavored snacks.
- She really hates Christmas. Really, _really_ hates Christmas— almost as much as she hates insects!
- Did I mention she has a deathly fear of insects?
- Honey really likes classical music and really hates techno of any kind. She likes jazz and can play trombone. 
- I like to imagine that some independent fishers go out paddle boarding to save on power and electricity. Also because they cant afford boats. Honey does this with a lot of her days, but a lot of the fishing areas are mostly filled with oil.. luckily for her, that means the fish float near the surface so she’s able to stab them. Shes a great paddler, she just doesnt like water bc she weighs like 2 tons (kidding). 
- I also like to headcanon that honey is so heavy, that when she sits down on a chair, she doesnt actually sit down or she’d break it. She does an electric chair squat instead.
*me and Chasmus’ creator don’t talk anymore. So I’m looking to replace Chasmus..*
- ***Honey and Chasmus***
    - Honey works alone in the CORE equivalent of Baguio (I HEART BAGUIO!!!!!!). She works with a street chef. She goes out to get materials because of her unmatched strength. She brings back fish and works in the farms (steals from the farms) and cuts and prepares them for less than minimum wage. She’s kind of miserable,, her boss treats her badly,,, but also, she’s a clone and clones have extremely bad reputation in that area. Due to construction and lack of funding she can’t get out, so she’s stuck there. Chasmus goes to her stand to buy some materials. Honey feels bad because Chasmus is like, 300 php off so she gives her a small piece of candy for free. Her boss did NOT like that!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE IN CRIPPLING FINANCIAL DEBT AND CANT AFFORD THAT!!  Honey gets the equivalent of like, public execution with her boss :sob:. The nearby people notice that her muscles and fat are artificial and she just kinda, slumps and hides and continues to skin the fish she just got.
    - It begins to rain. The train goes down because of it, so she can’t get into her apartment.
        - “Is *this* the life I fought to live…?”
            - This starts her motivation to make sure other people don’t live like she has.
    - Chasmus is walking to her restaurant, and she spots Honey sitting there. She offers her an umbrella and Honey just stares at her.
        - “… That was really good sisig,” says Chasmus. “Even if you mostly sell fish.”
        - Honey is flushed and looks to the side.
        - “Why do you let him treat you like that?”
        - “I don’t have a chioce. There’s no where else to go. | I’m a clone. You know that. Why do you continue to speak to me?”
        - “…”
            - Chasmus turns to a nearby vendor who’s walking by, selling Taho. She orders two of them and hands one to Honey.
                - “Repayment,” says Chasmus. “I got paid earlier.”
            - Honey takes the Taho without a word, but doesn’t eat it.
            - Shitty beta I made in 2 seconds
                You know,” says Chasmus. “My place, uh.. I think you’d go well there.”
                - “Even if my body is 90% metal?”
                - “What does that matter? | You paid for my meal. You were beaten for it. It’s the least I could do.”
                - “‘S not yer fault,, what’s the point of gettin’ mad over that?”
                - “I mean.. if anything, you’ve changed my view on, uh, cloning, and.. we need new recipes there, anyway.”
                - “Your business will go down if you have me there, I—.. I can’t do that to you, y’ know? | Yer too nice, you don’t deserve that.”
                - “I’m offering you a *job*.”
                - “He’ll *kill* me.”
                - “We have protection.”
                - “…”
                - “…”
                    - Chasmus takes off her scarf and wraps it around Honey’s wounds.
                - “You’re okay,” says Chasmus. “I’ll help you.”
                - “Why?”
                - “Think of it as repayment,” says Chasmus. 
            - tl;dr
                - Chasmus feels bad for her and is like, “you were kinda good at what u do I see ya workin so I think you shoudl get a job, also you shouldn’t let him do that to you” and honey says “but I’m 90% metal” and Chasmus says “stfu”
        - So honey is like, eternally grateful ;; the general restaurant is alright, pretty below average but tightly knit. She’s been working there for like, four years?

**Signature Ability**: Aloof
> 	Honeycakes takes no hit reactions from attacks that deal less than 10% of her MAX HP. while in SHIFT, this will increase to 20%. 
> 	Additionally, Honeycakes can just ignore gravity and decide to either fall faster or slower (depends on whether W/S or up arrow/down arrow is pressed while she is falling. )

Extended Ability: Heavyweight
> 	Landing on enemies from above deals bonus damage + armor break. Gain additional +50% damage if done while in SHIFT. 
> 	Enemies afflicted will gain +STUN for 3 seconds. While an enemy is stunned, gain +3% HP per second of the stun. (MAX 75%). This attack stacks for each stunned enemy.

**Role**: Heavyweight Tank
	You know the type. Heavy-hitting but hideously slow. That’s Honeycakes. Not much else to say!
	
**Base**: BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
> 	Honeycakes wields her nasty, nasty hammer to swing at enemies. Nothing’s too heavy for Honeycakes, but it still remains at an astounding 1 ton (joke). She swings quickly (for her standards) twice, then lands a third heavy hit which can launch the opponent. While in SHIFT, deal an additional fourth hit. 
> 	She doesn’t react to ANY hits while doing her third hit.

> 	Does not work on bosses.


“Patch notes” 
- Hard-Headed
• Upon activation, Honey suffers 25% dmg of all hits taken for the next 3 seconds or so, then launches it all back into one beam attack. However, this stuns her for a period of time and she takes 25% damage of max HP on recoil (set)
• Passive:
• +25% crit rate or knockback damage.
