Khan’s like that kid at the back of the classroom.

He’s the quiet kid with the dead sister. The one who he joined the army for, just for her to die a few days after acceptance. He’s the kid with the too-big ego and that fart of an old master. He’s the guy with the scars under his eyes and pursed lips and mutters about whatever war, and _Chou_, and Marian, and _Chou_ again.

Khan grew up in a temple in what was Southeast Asia as a monk of an unknown religion. He was the second youngest child in a family of sixteen children(mostly non blood related), who’d all either abandoned him or left for jobs in the bigger city.

The temple was already failing, and so was his sister. And his sister was all he had to him, he _was_ his sister, two halves of one whole, identical in their stoic nature and unmoving eyes. They were one of the same,

so Khan grasps her hands for one last time.

”I’ll come back.”

She stared at him with those pupiless eyes of hers.

”Please.”

And thus marked the day of Khan’s life of war.

He wasn’t a huge fan of Pithaces, but he wasn’t a big fan of Marian either. Not that he had any particular reason to dislike Marian, but simply because Marian _was in the way of his cash reward. A little brat who ran away for his own personal gain.

he remembers fighting through that coliseum alongside Marian and that rotting corpse of a swordsman, he remembers bleeding and sobbing and fighting until his limbs fell off and fat dribbled out from his arms. He remembers so much. Too much.

He remembers his sister’s face when he returned.

Lifeless.

Khan tries not to think about that part.

Now living his life in a desolate island, helping out in whatever temple needed him and running his own (albeit very unstable) small farm. Pyrrhon had no use for him anymore, he’d passed the required age.

(But he hadn’t self-destructed, yet.)

His life of fighting is over.

_Will they remember you when you’re gone?_

He spots the eye of an oddly familiar girl on the street,

And all he once knew was now obsolete in the face of God Himself.
