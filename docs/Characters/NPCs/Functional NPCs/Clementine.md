- Commonly labeled as Constantine’s evil brother. They are not related. Clement is a worker at the nearby contemporary church, but he mostly works as a spy and for public relations with those interested in TLH. He’s very charismatic and doesn’t really mind getting a few drinks and twisting the rules for his own benefit. Kind of a scoundrel. Quite manipulative and focuses on himself. Constantine hates him with a very burning passion but Clement teases him. He’s quite a good fighter.
- He doesn’t do very much. You can talk to him on occasion and he’s doing something or, if you bother him on a bad day of his, he’ll give you money to leave you alone.
- His outer disguise is as a worker at the nearby church, as stated. He works as an alter boy and is known for his beautiful choir voice and being the perfect angel. He is not. He is a twink ass bitch.
Clementine is sort of like a smiley.. Taiyo-ish.. strange and eccentric guy. He's self centered and works exclusively for himself. He doesnt even believe in the religion he's working for, he just does it for clout and benefits actually. Constantine doesn't agree with 90% of Clementines moral standings (which is ironic considering his line of work). Anyway, they do end up working together sometimes so people have theorized that they're in a relationship with each other.
