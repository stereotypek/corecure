**Does Honey love Regina?**
	*no not really. She more so sees Regina as a mother figure. She’s willing to do almost anything for Regina, sex or murder or just plain ol’ work. She’s like, “Regina has accepted me for who I am. loved the unlovable. And I think that’s beautiful”. Granted Regina is kind of a sadist, but Honey is a lot better because of Regina.
	She Was careful to not make the same mistakes she did with her other friends. She’s matured a lot.*
