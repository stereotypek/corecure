[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) is prone to psychotic and manic episodes. She's canonically bipolar so a normal day for her and [Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) would go like this.

[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) nears the end of her euphoric high. Something ticks her off and she ends up spiraling into mania or psychosis
She accepts every job available and kills everything she can, mostly at the cost of her own life.
Her fixers alert [Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md), who passively throws food her way so she doesn't die. [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) eats it up.
She spends a few hours mutilating corpses (cutting them up, eating their organs, playing with them, (REDACTED)ing them, throwing them around, or playing with them like dolls).
After a while she gets bored and fights until she drops. [Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) sedates her and takes her home at this time
She usually beats him up and they fight 

[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md): "The version of myself you cling so dearly to is long dead and gone! I don't understand *why* you keep coming back?! Are you stupid? You love like a fucking DOG. I fucking hate you. I hate you so goddamn much. Are you fucking stupid? JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!!! I don't need your comfort-- I don't *want* your comfort you stupid fucking MUTT!! The '[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)' you love so dearly is DEAD!!! DO YOU GET KT YET, YOU DUMB FUCK DOG? OR DO YOU NEED ME TO KICK YOUR CHEST IN FOR YOU TO GET IT?!! I HATE YOU!!!! I HATE YOU SO MUCH!! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?! WHY WH--"
([Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) short circuits)
[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md), covered in blood and bruises shakily gets up and drags her back to his room, repairing her slowly through the night.
[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) remembers none of it again, but the crusts in her limbs are stained with dried blood. 
[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) just stares down at her with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes
Lips cut and cheeks burnt 
...
[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) alters [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md)s memories CONSTANTLY. He feels guilty for it but "it's for her own good". [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) doesn't know bc if she did she would probably kill him for real.
so this night wouldn't happen in her ram. But it exists in long term.
His reasoning for this heavily is based on
"If she remembers, she'll spiral (if she remembers, my creation leaves me)."
[Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) is very heavy on the self sustainable, non tampered version of clones. she despises memory and consciousness editing.
[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) does it half for his own safety but also half for himself. If [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) fails, it's like. [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) is his reason for living. He doesn't see her  as a person, he sees her as his project and his pride and joy.
"She -she doesn't want to remember anyway! I'm the only one who can save her.."
he doesn’t believe [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) can handle herself without him. Which is true, but also ableist on his part. This isn't his call to make.
[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) is NOT a good person, I want to make this very very clear. None of the core characters are  good people. Not at all.

He adds fake memories of [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md), so she pretends to have had a great childhood. To have has amazing friends, instead of face reality. 

[Constantine](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Constantine.md) can't break down and cry about it because that'll risk his identity. That's why he's so close to Shenx, because Shenx knows what he does to [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) and it's the most powerful blackmail material out of ALL of them. It's why he's so obsessed to sucking shenx's dick in every aspect and why Shenx absolutely revels in it


He isn’t noble. He’s not healthy. He’s addicted to [Gamma](CΓÖíRE/Characters/Playable Characters/Gamma.md) as a concept, to the ghost of the girl he thinks he saved, and to his own guilt and messiah complex. He takes hits like a dog because he doesn’t believe he deserves anything better. And really, maybe he doesn’t. He knows she’ll tear him apart—physically, mentally, spiritually—but he doesn’t care. He's given up, maybe.
