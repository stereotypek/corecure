### Personality 

Dinh is an asshole. Fights with daggers. Doesn’t talk much and mutters out every single sentence. It’s difficult to hear her. She likes gothic clothing and sharp objects. Arguably the most level headed of the group, and leads everyone around. They mostly interpret her commands by just the situation at hand and her body movement. Currently holds the most resentment towards [Honeycakes](../../Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), since she and Omega were the main subjects of their fight

### Fighting Style

Midrange stealth shark. good with both short and long range (long is chip, short is good dmg). Most of her stats go into speed and magic defense, though her offense is quite low and is prone to physical attacks.

Throws daggers of various origin at her opponent, not controlled by magic. Alternatively, her fingers are embedded with a ’nail launcher’, which fire off sharp spikes at high speeds. 

Usually she will hit you with her long range knives first, then while you’re stunned, will come up behind you and slit your throat. 

Quite good with being silent and sneaky, which makes her a good shark. However catching her off guard means that she’s done for.

The most observant, but also the most hesitant of the group. 

### Relations

[Kit](Kit.md): pathetic little girl. But she is useful. I’m sorry you have to deal with those two (Adam and OMEGA). I hate them more than I hate you, so I will help you out.

[Adam](Adam.md): Incompetent brute. but a good fighter when he decides to listen to me.

[Omega](Omega.md): Too loud, but our best fighting unit.
