Coda is [Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md)s ex-boyfriend. They, unlike Baluch and [Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md), are on great terms.

His full name is Coda#4 (Coda-Sharp-Four)

## Personality 

Coda is a hesitant, soft-spoken guy for such a great musician. He’s charming and cool to the public, but in private, he mostly likes to be alone. He’s not really struggling, but he isn’t particularly famous either. Has a great moral code, but will do what he needs to do to survive. 

Coda isn’t a great fighter, so he tends to avoid conflict. He can use magic (the conductors wand which he uses, which can also serve as a bow for his double bass if he so wishes) to launch soft projectiles. He just doesn’t really like fighting, he has other things to worry about.

Coda’s kind of a wallflower. He sticks to himself and prioritizes himself. Of course, [Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md) does too, but she’s a lot meaner about it. 

## Family

Coda comes from a distinct family of people. The family line goes something like this: (bassie, Altima, tena, mezzimo, and sorprania) (ionia) 

Unlike the rest of his family, he is not a part of the mafia. He instead enjoys rock and jazz, and conducts in his own little jazz band: Mixie (play on Mixolydio, his grandfather.) with [Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md).

*Coda-sharp-four* is his full name. This is because his family has already exhausted all music terms, so he could either be named sforzando b3 (Flat three) or Coda#4.
The sharps are reserved for the men, while the flats are reserved for the women. Obviously the number will change based on how many times the name was used. While additions like these are for chords, they had to make do with it.

There is a man in his family named Cmajb55.



## Relationship With Nea

[Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md) played the Tenor sax,

And Coda was their bassist (Electric and trad). 

[Nea](../../Playable Characters/Nea.md) was the most advanced in music theory and was their best player. They’d both had similar experiences with hating music in their childhood, so they got along quite well. Since Coda and Nea both enjoy music, they were extremely close, like brother and sister. 

Coda and Nea were kind of pressured to date each other by his family (and whatever was left of Nea’s), so they did. They kissed a few times, but they weren’t really romantically in love at all. They eventually broke up and decided to be friends.

She still plays in Mixie, but much less frequently. Coda is (somewhat) understanding (He doesn’t know what she’s even talking about) of her situation, and the rest of Mixie just assumed she’d died or something, or that she had gotten into a big fight with Coda. They’re quite well off, though.

Nea doesnt have much real resentment towards Coda. it was weird for her to not be shamed and beaten by whatever boyfriend she had at the time. She dislikes coda for that reason.
