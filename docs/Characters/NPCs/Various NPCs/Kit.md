### Personality

Kit is a ??? Year old with nothing in her head. She, like [Dinh](Dinh.md), is also barely able to be heard and speaks though mutters. Unlike [Dinh](Dinh.md), she speaks frequently and sounds like a white noise machine. Kit also shakes (mostly out of fear and anxiety) and finds it extremely hard to speak for herself at all. She has incredible anxiety which is NOT helped by [Adam](Adam.md) and spends most of her time trembling in fear. [Dinh](Dinh.md) feels very bad for her and tries to give her some peace away from Omega and [Adam](Adam.md), but they both find pleasure in seeing Kit fall over and sob so they ruin her day always. Kit has no idea what the hell is happening at any time since she is too scared to even remember a single thing. The reason she has her dolls there is because she crafts them to fight for her, since she is terrified of pain

### Fighting Style

Well. She stands at a far distance and fires off her dolls. Extreme magic capabilities since the dolls do have mild sentience.

if she had grown up, she could have easily started a whole new religion due to her power. However she did not. 

The dolls run and grasp at the victim while she runs in fear. Strength in numbers! They will tear the victim fully apart using brute force (their limbs do have rocks. individually, they’re quite painless. But, when there’s about twenty of them…)

she is like Bedman from Guilty Gear, but instead of a single entity it’s just a multitude of entities. 

In game, hypothetically, pressing the attack button would have a doll run out from Kit’s bag and just run straight forward. if you spam it enough, you can lag your game out but also erase anything on GROUND level. air enemies? She can just run and Hide. Luckily, she’s good at running away from issues. 

### Relations 

Her thoughts on:

[Adam](Adam.md): My Big brother.. (positive connotation) 

[Omega](Omega.md): my older brother… (negative connotation)

[Dinh](Dinh.md): scary,, but she is still my mom.
