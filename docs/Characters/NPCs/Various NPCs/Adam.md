### Personality 

Adam is a real fucking piece of work. A well-natured guy who feeds off of adrenaline, fear, and strange fetishes. Enjoys the taste of iron and flesh. Has rabies probably. If you look at him he’s shaking and drooling and barely able to contain himself. Very erratic and switches moods frequently. Extremely impatient but has compassion for his friends and his friends *only*. 

### Fighting Style

Physical attacker with high defense but low speed. Not particularly a tank, since most of his stats go into offense than defense.

His fits grow to comically large sizes and he uses it to tackle and pin down people.

Due to his genetics and sharp teeth (if you look closely they have barbs), he will just gnaw off people’s arms and ropes and wires. 

NO magical capabilities whatsoever.

[Dinh](Dinh.md) describes him as a hawk, since he usually hides in the shadows (usually walking on all fours), then lunches at his prey with his hands. He keeps his victim pinned down while he severs the central nerve in their neck with his teeth and feeds.

he has the jaw of a panda and can chew through almost anything. he also doesnt mind how many things taste, BUT he exclusively eats meat. He will spit out everything else.


### Relations

[Kit](Kit.md): Ah, god. She’s so cute. I gotta keep her safe. And what the hell is in those dolls?! C’mon, Kit, get behind me! I’ll handle these guys. you’re so cute when you tremble like that! (Takes joy in terrorizing her).

[Omega](Omega.md): the only one who really *gets* me, but he can be such a Jerk!

[Dinh](Dinh.md): stuck up princess. But, we’re on the same page sometimes.
