God is dead. We killed him. The Earth is inhabited by mutated trees, insects, and disease-ridden fish. From greed came war, and from war came disease. Plants and Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body. The only things left were the insects which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures. They\u2019d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought. In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End. The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens. The rapture had begun. Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it\u2019s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped. As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton. The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God. It\u2019s the ultimate mothers womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it. There was a small girl inside of it. `Her name was Kei.` The last living ruler of Beau\u2019s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger. A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis. That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon\u2019s Golden Rule. She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch. Everything seemed fine. And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant. Everything has since been stuffed under the rug. With each disease cured, came millions of dead bodies. With each city liberated, came another pointless regulation. `Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug.` `To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too.` With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning. Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously young, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been. With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person. Pyrrhon. From her goal of reversing Beau\u2019s tyranny, she had become even worse. It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous \u2018clone army\u2019. This marked the years until now as \u201cThe Age of Eugenics\u201d, because that\u2019s what it was and still is. And everything\u2019s crumbling, all the same. tl;dr Anyway, think of LA and New York. Compress it into a really awful city. Think of the Earth. Take out 75% of it and then replace it with your LA/NY concoction. That is CORE. CORE\u2019s this platformer hack-n-slasher which takes place in an ugly cyberpunk landscape. While in the small corners of the Earth, there remain tribes and temples, most of the world has been overrun by capitalism and war. It\u2019s known as the Age of Eugenics, all run under Pyrrhon : a 200-year-old dictator who looks suspiciously like a 20 year old woman. When she\u2019s not imposing laws or censoring opinions, you\u2019ll find her with a test tube and a nucleus, in hopes of discovering immortality. Pyrrhon is a clone fanatic. She found the perfectly genetic being, or at least what she thought was the perfectly genetic being, and cloned and cloned and cloned until the Earth was overrun with them. The Earth is dying. But who really cares about that, anyway? Because once she destroys and rebuilds Earth in her perfect image , everything\u2019s going to be okay..

It\u2019s part of mine.\u201d(H) \u201cYou.. you traitor!\u201d (G) \u201cDon\u2019t forget your place. You work under me.\u201d(H) \u201c\u2026 (fidgeting)\u201d(G) \u201cAnd your eye?\u201d(H) \u201cHm? Oh, yes\u2026\u201d (flicks up hair) \u201cit\u2019s gorgeous, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s fresh, too. Shame I have to give it away.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want that one. I want the other one.\u201d \u201cUh? The one from that little girl?\u201d \u201c Chou .\u201d \u201cAh, yes.. I remember. Your mother..~ a real cute one, she was. I loved her, so much..~ she barely lasted. Barely lasted..\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d (Tosses sandwich) \u201cthey\u2019re mantises.\u201d \u201cAh!~ you remembered? Awww, Herod says he loves you~\u201d (Incomprehensible noises from Herod) \u201c\u2026\u201d before that Honeycakes : I saved both of your pathetic lives. You\u2019re coming with me. Gamma : it\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s 3 in the morning..? Honeycakes : I\u2019m here to beat morning traffic, not listen to you complain. Get moving. Nea , you come too. Gamma : she\u2019s passed out. She won\u2019t wake up. Honeycakes : is that so? Well, load her up. Make sure she doesn\u2019t run, so tie her up. Gamma : wh-what if she wakes up..?! Honeycakes : she\u2019ll be fine. I won\u2019t let anything happen to her. Gamma : .. Honeycakes : You want to be a real clone soldier? Then listen to me. I\u2019m your superior. Let\u2019s get moving. Gamma : tch. Gamma : where are we going, anyway? Honeycakes : visiting an old friend of mine. She has something I want. (Honey drugged Nea so she wouldn\u2019t wake up) SO Honey\u2019s goal: get Chou \u2019s eye Why? It has Chou \u2019s DNA\u2014 her DNA. Why? She just wants to have it. Now, Mutilation is extremely strong and quite literally revives herself. She\u2019s rich and lives deep, deep in the mountain. She has guards and everything. Gamma : how did you even meet her..!? Honeycakes : Like me, she\u2019s a high up. You\u2019re a soldier, act like it. Gamma : Y-.. yes ma\u2019am! Honey\u2019s a bit suicidal which is why she made this plan up in the first place. But she\u2019s tired of Mutiliation\u2019s very existence, so she brings in Nea . She discovered that Nea has a directly opposite blood type to Mutilation , AND Marian \u2019s CORE. Since Marian \u2019s CORE is covered with Nea \u2019s blood and is a newer CORE update, she will explode internally. So when it comes in contact with Marian \u2019s CORE, it will attempt to auto-update to absorb the CORE. However, since her CORE is a custom job, the CORE realizes that a lot of checksums are missing and then realizes that something is wrong. Since it realizes that it has been tampered with, it will corrode instantly, killing Mutilation instantly, since it will kill her before she\u2019s able to revive herself. The plan generally goes as planned, but when Herod goes to eat Nea , Gamma snaps and attacks Mutilation. They obviously can\u2019t fight Mutilation because they\u2019re both outnumbered and Mutilation can very much kill the two of them. They get attacked but Honey manually restrains Gamma and tells Herod to eat Nea . It\u2019s really intense. Nea is about to fucking die Herod sinks its teeth into Nea \u2019s shoulder, as Honey instructs. That is where Honeycakes planted a bit of Nea \u2019s core, so Herod recoils and begins to melt and corrode. However she put too little and Mutilation catches onto the plan and attacks them. .. only she doesn\u2019t. Mutilation pins down Nea as she groggily begins to wake up and gets really freaky. \u201cI know ou. I know you! I KNOW YOU!!! I KNOW YUOU!!! Mother , youre my father my father my father MY FAHTER!! YOURE MY FAHTER.. \u201c She thinks that Marian is her father, and since it\u2019s Marian \u2019s CORE.. Marian isn\u2019t her father, she was just Pyrrhon\u2019s \u2018\u2019lover\u2019\u2019 Anyway the vicinity between Mutilation and Marian \u2019s CORE kinda fucks things up and Nea goes into a deep, deep digital flashback. so does Mutilation It lasts a second for Gamma and Honeycakes . But in there, Nea basically is attacked by Marian ( mutilation ). She stabs him, and Mutilation says, \u201cyou\u2019ve done so well..\u201d She gets flashbacks to when Marian offered her his CORE. The sensation is so intense that it disrupts the connection and backfires on Mutilation , killing her instnatly. Nea wakes up seeing Honey hanging up Mutilation like a slab of meat and sifting through the organs she wants to keep. She has Han cool them for her in a portable cooler. Gamma is mostly making sure Nea is okay Honeycakes : \u2026 Alright. That\u2019s about 10k Danari. Gamma : wh-.. WHAT??? NO ONE IS WORTH THAT MUCH!!! Honeycakes : look at these organs. They\u2019re branded. Don\u2019t you see the variety? You scan them yourself. They\u2019re soldiers\u2014 good soldiers. And these are in good shape. Gamma : you know, if you wanted to sell organs, you could\u2019ve just became a Merc! Honeycakes : hah. No, it was just this one time. I just wanted to get one, but.. 10k Danari is a nice farewell gift from her.\u2764\ufe0f She plucks out Chou \u2019s eye and places it into a jar. Honeycakes : there we are. Gamma : the hell is that? Honeycakes : It\u2019s your mother\u2019s eye. It\u2019s Chou \u2019s eye. Gamma : \u2026! Honeycakes : obviously Chou is dead. I don\u2019t intend on reviving her. Think of these as, \u201cher ashes\u201d. Gamma : wh-.. what did you plan to do with them? Honeycakes : look at it. Gamma : \u2026? Honeycakes : did you think I was going to clone her? I have a business to run. I just wanted to look at her. Gamma : that\u2019s why you risked Nea \u2019S LIFE??! Honeycakes : well, look. She\u2019s alive, isn\u2019t she? And she killed Mutilation . Honeycakes : don\u2019t worry. You both can keep 10 thousand D each. I already counted our shares. Han! Load up the cart, we\u2019re going to Ritas! The Honeycakes Romance Quest I had an idea So, Honeycakes is going out shopping for vegetables. She meets this little farmer girl, named Cherry. Cherry: my name is Cherry, like the food. Honeycakes : huh! Well, my name is Honey, like the candy! (Giggle snicker) They start to get along really well. Trading free food together.. cooking each other meals. One day, Honeycakes is invited to Cherry\u2019s farm for dinner. Honey brought over her steamed fish. Cherry: Honey! Can you pass me the knife? Honeycakes : Sure thing \u2764\ufe0f (She passes the knife. She holds it with a throwing grip, but she doesnt throw it.) (Dad glances at her wearily) Dad: \u2026 you two dating? (Cherry groans) Honeycakes : actually, no! Honey is my name! Dad: \u2026 Honeycakes : My full name is Honeycakes . First name honey, last name cakes. Dad: so.. mister cakes\u2014 Honeycakes : ms. I\u2019m a woman. (Dad glances at Honey\u2019s chest) Dad: .. are you sure? Cherry: dad!!! Don\u2019t do that!! (Dad leans back in his chair): you know, back in my day, Pyrrhon\u2019s empire didn\u2019t allow this sort of thing! Men were soldiers, and\u2014 Honeycakes : actually, a large majority of soldiers were transgender or gay! Pyrrhon didn\u2019t have any official laws against gay marriages, it was just because the church was so widespread 40 years ago, that it basically was a law. Cherry: huh? How old are you? Honeycakes : sixty (THIS IS A JOKE ITS UNOFFICIAL) ( Dinh comes up from behind, unaware that Honeycakes is ACTUALY Omega) Dinh : yeah? You look really good for a sixty year old. Honeycakes : tee hee \u2764\ufe0f (hasn\u2019t turned around) I\u2019m flattered~ Dinh : and you sure know an awful lot about the war back then, for a fisherman, at least. Honeycakes , turning around: well, I.. (She sees Dinh and freezes) (Her eyes drift naturally towards her chest) Dinh : my eyes are up here. Honeycakes : a-ack, sorry. Dinh : Right. Well, I suppose you\u2019ve caused enough of a commotion in this household. Honeycakes : r-right. I need to work! Se-see you later, Cherry! Cherry: huh? Aww.. (Silence as Honey leaves) Cherry: Dad!! You\u2019re so annoying!! You wanna talk about war laws? Honey lived through them. You read about them on conspiracy forums!! Dinh : Yeah? Cherry: Yeah! (Cherry doesn\u2019t really know about Honey\u2019s past) Dinh : where did you say she worked again? Cherry: umm.. (hands her a business card). ( Dinh raises an eyebrow) Soldiers have a special punctuation quirk to identify themselves as soldiers amongst other soldiers. It\u2019s mostly used for passing secret notes around. The notes are typically encrypted. Since everything a soldier writes must be with this particular quirk, (it looks like a random comma to the naked eye, but to the educated..) she\u2019s just never grown out of it. ( Dinh realizes that it\u2019s Honeycakes handwriting) Dinh :.. and where can I find this.. Iron Lantern (the name of the restaurant)? Cherry: h-huh? But I thought you didn\u2019t like Ha-Binh\u2019s food.. Dinh : hmph. ( Dinh just runs out, chasing after Honeycakes ) \u2014- Cherry falls in love with Honeycakes , unaware of Honey\u2019s past. Honey just assumes that Cherry is being nice to her. Once Cherry confesses, Honey almost has a breakdown and pretty violently tells Cherry that she knows nothing about who Honey is, and what she\u2019s done. Cherry tries telling her that that\u2019s okay, and she\u2019s willing to forgive her. She jokingly throws in, \u201cit\u2019s not like you\u2019re a national guardian or anything. Coz then my dad wouldda killed you! And Dinh probably would really like you more.\u201d \u2026 Anyway. as Honey finally relents and allows Cherry to lean in for a kiss, Cherry is stabbed. she slumps into Honey\u2019s chest. Dinh stabbed Cherry, thinking it was Honey. It was dark.. easy mistake. Honey goes a little bit apeshit and almost kills her. Cecelia and Diana two twin girls, one pink and one purple. They follow around Myazaki to an obsessive extent. They\u2019re like Mya\u2019s little sisters, and take everything Mya says as law. Will defend Mya til the day they die. Diana is optimistic and trigger happy. Despite being a nurse, she carries a pistol with her at all times. She smiles in even the strangest situations, and finds herself giggling at almost everything. She likes to joke around with her patients and say, \u201cuh oh! This parts infected! We\u2019ll cut it out~ Diana, please give me the chainsaw!\u201d Cecelia is the more level-headed one. The compassionate, though quieter girl of the twins. She still remains optimistic but is a lot gentler with what she does. She caries around a sniper rifle with her, also despite being a nurse. She\u2019s incredibly obsessive over Mya even to the point of deterring Diana from approaching Mya too much. Cecelia frankly doesn\u2019t care, and is just happy to have something to do. Myazaki a brute-force sort of girl. Similarly to Honeycakes , she was a war veteran, but turned into a nurse. Or, she\u2019s trying to. She\u2019s very strict and stern, like an old traditional woman. She has a harsh glare and generally scares everyone away when she approaches them. Looks like an absolute punk. Incredibly muscular, but does her best to be gentle. However, she usually ends up destroying it anyway. Mya was initially weary of Cecelia and Diana, but since they were both nurses, she decided to keep them around to hopefully ease everyone\u2019s worries about her. Rumors only spread about Mya, and she\u2019s.. incredibly depressed about them. I had an idea where Myazaki left for a single afternoon to go get food in another city. Cecelia and Diana are freaking the FUCK out when they catch Honeycakes in the distance beating the shit out of some clankers (sorry). And theyre like \u201cHOLY SHIT !!! SHES PERFECT!!\u201d And start to swarm Honeycakes and ask if they could acompany her. I jsut thought it would be really funny to have Honeycakes of ALL PEOPLE be off put by something . Insert quest content here. e if they saw Mya and were like \u201cOH MY GOD MYA WE THOUGHT YOU DIED\u201d and latch off of Honeycakes and back onto Mya sobbing and crying. And Mya is exasperated and like \u201c\u2026 I just got take out.\u201d And Cecelia and Diana just leave Honeycakes forever alone, but you can at least get a discount whenver you travel to their area in game. Swamp King III The tl;dr for this side quest goes as follows: Honeycakes and Constantine are paddle boarding and hunting for fish Honeycakes : haha, if you're not careful, the merfolk will kidnap you! Constantine : wh-what? Honeycakes : They live in pools like this.. and they'll EAT YOU!!! (cackle) Constantine : i'm 23, Honey. Honeycakes : keh. you're no fun. Can you hand me that--? ... const is gone ..... Honey scans the water. all mineral oil? no wonder there was no fish! But where are they?.. Honey jumps in to find Constantine : and finds a full underwater society. She also finds Nea trying to fix her hair. Like they're both swept into a whirlpool and \"what the hell are you doing here??\", soaked and dripping in a humid sewer system. I imagine it like . the mermaid society in the mlp movie LOL. Nea is swept in completely separately. Like she has no idea why honey is there. \u201cBleghhhghghh\u2014 Nea ???\u201d \u201cI can't work under these conditions. WAIT WHAT THE FUCK\u201d Anyway they go around to go find Constantine :. Turns out, because of his mask they thought he was a cyborg and they were gonna scrap him for parts. Gamma and Nea were actually on a cleaning job together, and Gamma looked away for a bit, and Nea fell into a whirlpool. So Gamma is probably super pissed. Anyway the society is kind of like.. weird. Weird criminals who live under the plates of the ground, but not a part of the real underground society. More black-market-y than the normal black market. Sorta like dogtown from cyberpunk. Anyway I dunno what happens in the middle, but eventually after a huge fight, it ends with a gunshot coming from the corner\u2026 Gamma /!!??!? she runs at Nea with a knife and is like \u201cI HAD TO CLEAN THAT WHOLE POOL BY MYSLEF!!!!\u201d And she was so angry she even worked with the local police to go find Nea . But they ended up taking down a huge crime ring that lived in the sewers. Not associated with the normal swamp king side quest. General single int Loveless\u2019s wife quest This weird kid keeps bothering everyone and complains that there\u2019s an alien abduction happening. If you go to the area at that time, there actualy IS an alien abduction and you have to kill every single one of them NPC friend says \"someone wanted this ring, but I cant deliver it myself. Can you?\" And then when you turn around it gets stolen so you need to make a new one Alternatively you could track down the robber. It's just the NPC who says \"I changed my mind\". After you stab him, he just dusts himself off and walks away So when youre tracking down Vee (the villain for the intro), a suspicious mafia boss says he'll give you information if you pay him 1 USD. You give him one USD and he says \"Kay, next, you need to steal the cash register from the local department store and then I'll give it to you.\" And so you do that and you find him shot dead so you just take the cash register and get a lot of money. He has a treasure chest in his hands which may or may not be real (its not) A band leader named Billiam Smakespar lost his most important possession- his cyborg singer! \"Okay so I was out partying and I lost her power source, can you find it?I'll mark the area on your map for you!\" A restaurant wants you to kill all of the people leaving bad reviews on their store A local department store wants you to play security and kick out any bad customers for a higher rating. The 'bad customers' in question are people who have comically large weaponry. There is an exception. He is a penguin. \" i was going to bring this pack of fish to my daughter. but you stabbed me. who will feed my daughter now? \" The sewers have mutant rats which run around the city. They\u2019re mean to deal with so if you just go to the sewers and kill the queen, they stop attacking you. You also get the rats head as a medal I had a side quest for Gamma since she does mercenary work wgeee one of her weird ex's hired her, initially to kill some ppl, but it turned out he just wanted to have a final date with her have to go through a gambling hall (casino like thing) pipeline\u2026.u play card games to gain info on smth Crashing a large party with Shenx and Constantine : to obtain information Go on a date with Huangzhi You need to find two twins: one of them is named This One, and the other one is named That One.

That is where Honeycakes planted a bit of Nea \u2019s core, so Herod recoils and begins to melt and corrode. However she put too little and Mutilation catches onto the plan and attacks them. .. only she doesn\u2019t. Mutilation pins down Nea as she groggily begins to wake up and gets really freaky. \u201cI know ou. I know you! I KNOW YOU!!! I KNOW YUOU!!! Mother , youre my father my father my father MY FAHTER!! YOURE MY FAHTER.. \u201c She thinks that Marian is her father, and since it\u2019s Marian \u2019s CORE.. Marian isn\u2019t her father, she was just Pyrrhon\u2019s \u2018\u2019lover\u2019\u2019 Anyway the vicinity between Mutilation and Marian \u2019s CORE kinda fucks things up and Nea goes into a deep, deep digital flashback. so does Mutilation It lasts a second for Gamma and Honeycakes . But in there, Nea basically is attacked by Marian ( mutilation ). She stabs him, and Mutilation says, \u201cyou\u2019ve done so well..\u201d She gets flashbacks to when Marian offered her his CORE. The sensation is so intense that it disrupts the connection and backfires on Mutilation , killing her instnatly. Nea wakes up seeing Honey hanging up Mutilation like a slab of meat and sifting through the organs she wants to keep. She has Han cool them for her in a portable cooler. Gamma is mostly making sure Nea is okay Honeycakes : \u2026 Alright. That\u2019s about 10k Danari. Gamma : wh-.. WHAT??? NO ONE IS WORTH THAT MUCH!!! Honeycakes : look at these organs. They\u2019re branded. Don\u2019t you see the variety? You scan them yourself. They\u2019re soldiers\u2014 good soldiers. And these are in good shape. Gamma : you know, if you wanted to sell organs, you could\u2019ve just became a Merc! Honeycakes : hah. No, it was just this one time. I just wanted to get one, but.. 10k Danari is a nice farewell gift from her.\u2764\ufe0f She plucks out Chou \u2019s eye and places it into a jar. Honeycakes : there we are. Gamma : the hell is that? Honeycakes : It\u2019s your mother\u2019s eye. It\u2019s Chou \u2019s eye. Gamma : \u2026! Honeycakes : obviously Chou is dead. I don\u2019t intend on reviving her. Think of these as, \u201cher ashes\u201d. Gamma : wh-.. what did you plan to do with them? Honeycakes : look at it. Gamma : \u2026? Honeycakes : did you think I was going to clone her? I have a business to run. I just wanted to look at her. Gamma : that\u2019s why you risked Nea \u2019S LIFE??! Honeycakes : well, look. She\u2019s alive, isn\u2019t she? And she killed Mutilation . Honeycakes : don\u2019t worry. You both can keep 10 thousand D each. I already counted our shares. Han!

Honey brought over her steamed fish. Cherry: Honey! Can you pass me the knife? Honeycakes : Sure thing \u2764\ufe0f (She passes the knife. She holds it with a throwing grip, but she doesnt throw it.)

(Dad leans back in his chair): you know, back in my day, Pyrrhon\u2019s empire didn\u2019t allow this sort of thing! Men were soldiers, and\u2014 Honeycakes : actually, a large majority of soldiers were transgender or gay! Pyrrhon didn\u2019t have any official laws against gay marriages, it was just because the church was so widespread 40 years ago, that it basically was a law. Cherry: huh? How old are you?

(Cherry doesn\u2019t really know about Honey\u2019s past) Dinh : where did you say she worked again? Cherry: umm.. (hands her a business card). ( Dinh raises an eyebrow) Soldiers have a special punctuation quirk to identify themselves as soldiers amongst other soldiers. It\u2019s mostly used for passing secret notes around. The notes are typically encrypted. Since everything a soldier writes must be with this particular quirk, (it looks like a random comma to the naked eye, but to the educated..) she\u2019s just never grown out of it.

The backstory and lore of Khan , Marian , Shenx , Chou , Pyrrhon , Uche , and Padme . It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Marian signs away to the National Guardian\u2014 a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him. Now, the process for becoming a National Guardian is quite complex, despite the growing need for their presence. It all begins in the Colosseum, where all candidates are trained under a group of 6-8 people for three grueling weeks. They\u2019re trained by rough military professionals, trained to stick together like troops and to fight. It\u2019s genuinely so horrific that many of the soldiers drop out, or die from this. This is done to weed out the weaker ones. Marian is placed in a group with Pitaches, his leader. A grumpy old man with little to no regard for anyone but himself. And another boy, named Khan. And ten others. Now, this group was Kind of like a band of misfits. The leftovers. The only two who survived the initial 12 was Khan and Marian. This is SIGNIFICANTLY less than most, with most troops ending at 4-6 people final. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Yes, Khan and Marian hate each other. Yes, Khan thinks Marian is egotistical for his motivations. But ultimately, their shared hatred for Pithaches (pronounced Pith- ahh- keys) trumps their hatred for each other. so the final test in the Colosseum is like a hunger games sort of thing and it\u2019s played live for the public. It\u2019s like their NFL. They end up coming in fourth place. Welcome to the national guardian association, group 24601! Now, the real fun begins. Being a national guardian here is quite nice! Climb up the ranks, get sent on missions.. it\u2019s like being a legal mercenary, but you don\u2019t choose the shots\u2014 Pyrrhon does! Marian, as time goes on, grows more passive. A bit more mature. less like that immature, fierce little boy he was before and more like a stoic, warmer figure. Khan, as time goes on, grows more aggressive. A bit more immature, less like that mature, stoic, and warmer child he was before. And more like an immature, fierce, hardcore guy. They start to fight, obviously. They didn\u2019t know what else to do. Marian, after a particularly rough mission, finds Pithaces dead in a ditch somewhere. He doesn\u2019t tell Khan, just dragging Pithace\u2019s corpse into a 6 foot hole and burying him silently. Without incense, without thanks or regrets. A sign was stabbed into the thick, crusted metal of the Earth which read \u201cPITHACES\u201d in the worst handwriting possible. Not that Marian knew how to write anyway, so it probably read something else. Anyway. He and Khan go more separate into their opposite ways. Until one day, they\u2019re sent on a mission with Uche and Padme . Now, they were sent in particular to put down the ANGELS, a rouge AI which was taking over the dead corpses of clones in the mountains of Ngima (Reference H\u00e0-Binh ). Now, Khan and Marian\u2019s quarrels were so incredibly destructive that this was actually a suicide mission. They weren\u2019t supposed to actually take out the angels. Uche and Padme are odd scenarios. Uche is a warrior, and Padme is a magician. Neither of them want to be there, but they\u2019re attached at the hip. A packaged deal! Uche and Padme are difficult to describe. But they\u2019re like the bookman clan in D. Gray-Man. They\u2019re spies, not meant to really do much. Uche and Padme are just the names that they\u2019d chosen for this mission in particular. Anyway, against all odds, after many greuling months and almost a year, the angels are completely wiped out thanks to the four of them. They call themselves the ULTIMATE DREAM TEAM!! (Two exclamation marks included). Padme and Uche, despite how much fun they had, are whisked away for their next mission. History was recorded with the angels, they have no need to be with them. Khan and Marian are lead to believe Uche and Padme died in combat right after. In reality, Uche and Padme live in the mountains together. They\u2019ve been long retired, enjoying their lives. anyway Khan and Marian slowly begin to reconnect. About their shared hatred for Pithaces. On a particular night, tipsy and buzzed, they see a young girl being thrown out of an office building. Marian watches her with an odd curiosity. In short, he and Khan feel incredible pity for her and decide to help her get a job with the national guardian society. They find out that Chou has perfect genetics, and they whisk her away to be an egg donor. Khan and Marian think they\u2019ve done well and go out to drink and celebrate. Chou was condemned to death. Chou is the mother of all of the clones. By the end of her days with the national guardian, she was horrifically mutated and missing an eye and both of her arms. She holds them in incredibly high regard though. For some odd reason. Kei awakens at this time. TW FOR RAPE Marian is suddenly called up to Pyrrhon\u2019s lair. See, Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Not because of his looks or odd morals, but simply because Kei glanced in his vague direction one day. She saw it as a \u2018prophecy\u2019, from God himself. Now, Pyrrhon\u2019s all powerful, and her obsession with Kei has caused her to slip, and she can do whatever she wants with him\u2026 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon. \u201cIt just has to be *you*.\u201d That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. The bar is dingy, like the night that Marian sold his soul. Humid and dense, paint peeling off the walls. He talks with Khan. Not fight, Talk . Quite literally the first civil conversation Marian had had with another person in years. They talk about Pithaces. His death. Chou. Their experiences with Padme and Uche. Their other shared missions. It\u2019s then that Marian begins to break down about \u2026 refer to the dev notes for more So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. And so, Marian went on a mission (his last mission). He took her, Khan, and Chou with him to finish up the mission (Chou was there because she needed to be transported\u2014 Khan and Marian just so happened to run into her). The mission was to basically put down a rebellion/rebel group named \u201cThe Last Hope\u201d. Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you always say. But, just listen to me! Just this once! It\u2019ll happen!..\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). \u2026 A particular ten year old brat drowning in his own blood and vomit stirs amongst the rubble. refer to Shenx for more information \u2026 Marian remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. DEV NOTES. TW FOR RAPE In short, Marian and Pyrrhon are NOT ideal. This is, in fact, the least ideal situation possible. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon. \u201cIt just has to be you .\u201d Pyrrhon. She fully believes that what she\u2019s doing is right. She doesn\u2019t register Marian\u2019s age or consent as an issue, rewriting reality to fit her needs. \u201cOur new beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cYour body, your blood.. it will outlast all of us. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? To think, that you will be a part in this?\u201d Marian has no power to say no. He does attempt to resist, thrashing out of the grip of the metallic arms. But no use, he\u2019s injected with a tranquilizer straight to the neck. The next thing he knows, he wakes up to a clone of Pyrrhon riding him. he yells, something . But he can\u2019t even understand his own words at that point. It\u2019s Awful. It doesn\u2019t feel good. But it feels oddly heavenly. sending chills up his spine and makes his guts coil together. He feels sick. He wants to throw up but he\u2019s simply too weak. His eyes roll back into his head. It isn\u2019t even pleasurable, he can\u2019t feel it in the first place. Drool trickles down his cheek, eyes half-glazed over as he gazes into the eyes of THE CLONE. As if letting go of the last shreds of his life, He lets the seeds of the dandelion fly off and flutter into the wind. Marian\u2019s vision goes black again. Anyway, Marian is kinda let out of Pyrrhon\u2019s lair traumatized and unable to speak. He goes to a bar with Khan. He sobs, no one will believe him. And those who did, said he should be grateful for it. Khan believed him though. Khan and Marian both stop by a bar and kinda go over what\u2019s happened to them so far. How far they\u2019ve come. How they\u2019re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. his relationship with Khan turned into some odd, homoerotic relationship. Where Khan feels bad for everything he did to Marian. And Marian is fucking the shit out of Khan just to feel something, anything . Khan doesn\u2019t know if he consents to it, but Khan just knows he\u2019s part of the reason why this happened to Marian in the first place. He needs to help Marian. After all, Marian is his best friend, right? Marian feels nothing afterward. Not shame, nor pleasure. Just the feeling of his release churning into Khan. And Khan, he wants to help, yes. But he doesn\u2019t know how. He doesn\u2019t know how to say no without abandoning Marian. It\u2019s not sex, like a dance. It\u2019s like a mechanical ritual. With no pleasure involved, except for the churning of organs and the creaking of joints and the bed beneath them.

He was a fierce warrior even at like. Age ten. So of course he fought with them!

Pyrrhon is a scientist. Like most scientists, she creates experiments. To test emotional intelligence and bonding under artificial stress. Pyrrhon \u2019s theory: \u201cIf we can make even broken clones function as a unit, we can make anyone loyal.\u201d The Scrapcore unit\u2014 Dinh , Adam , Omega , and Kit \u2014were dropped into a controlled \u201cwasteland\u201d sim zone. Fake urban ruins. No food, minimal gear. Monitored 24/7. Neural data streamed into Pyrrhon \u2019s labs. No win condition. The test was meant to collapse after 30 days, with behavioral breakdowns studied for refinement. Begin. INSERT STUFF HERE they get out. The camera feeds fuzzed. Pyrrhon marked them as \u201cLOST ASSETS.\u201d But she was still watching. In the forgotten sector, surrounded by discarded tech, malfunctioning AIs, and broken clone pods, the four made a base. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. The system didn\u2019t know what to do with them. They became something of an urban legend among failed clones: a ghost team. Unstable but free. They weren\u2019t a rebellion, at least not in Pyrrhon\u2019s eyes. They were a malfunction. She saw Omega \u2019s rebellion not as failure, but as defiance. Personal betrayal. So she took it personally . Pyrrhon decided to test her new weapon: a miniaturized, precision-targeted doomsday laser, a condensed nuke, designed to melt cities from orbit. Testing it on Omega was the perfect test. Pyrrhon grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s see what hope looks like under 8 trillion kelvin.\u201d Omega was locked in a containment chamber\u2014torture-level clean, clinical, and pressurized. As most laboratories are. And the laser fires up. Omega looks at Pyrrhon . Pyrrhon only smiles. the machine whirs in the back, heat gurgling from its engine and seeping out into the tip, ready to\u2014! Pyrrhon sat with her torso scratched from falling debris. Blood trickled down onto the floor. Her first injury this century. Omega , carried in the arms of Dinh , went into an escape pod. But Omega looked back at the moment of the laser\u2019s first test-firing. Even just one glance at the beam\u2019s ignition\u2014through transparent shielding\u2014was enough to permanently destroy his eyesight. Retinas flash-boiled. Optic nerves scorched. A scream cut short by shock. \u2026 A biotech-enhanced spatial sensor was surgically implanted in her skull. It translates physical surroundings into a 3D representation in her brain\u2014like a sonar map + LIDAR system. It\u2019s \u201csight,\u201d but not the same. No colors. No light. Only shapes, distance, motion, and pressure. He can, in fact, see , but everything looks like a haunting, low-poly wireframe world.

Nea, Gamma, and the others have to shoot the other body guards) you need to manually shoot the guard in a time limited event. If you miss the shot, then Gamma will shoot them for you. However Shenx and Gamma will grimace. Try not to make yourself look like a fool.. wouldn\u2019t want them to think you\u2019re a little princess, would ya?

Your friend.. well, she\u2019ll need to be in our contract. (Shenx slides over a contract) S: By signing this, you become a mercenary under my control. S: Not like you have much of a say in this situation, anyway. (Nea hesitates, but signs it) (Shenx smiles) S: and there goes your records as well. G: Why did they get on there in the first place?! Don\u2019t you know how much danger this is gonna put us in?! S: my records were there. Everyone\u2019s records were there. G: what?! G: You\u2019re telling me you have a security flaw?! S: Quiet down. We checked, but.. S: it\u2019s not a normal hacker. It\u2019s an AI. S: Your brother is hunting it down right now. The server it\u2019s located in, at least. G: You\u2019re letting that SICKLY little BASTARD HUNT DOWN AN ENEMY OF THE PUBLIC??? S: You can go look for him if you\u2019d like. G: Nea! We\u2019re going! N: uh?! (Spaced out) S: Just what I like to hear!~ please buy me one of Regina\u2019s mango smoothies when you get back! (They leave) So anyway the thing that blackmailed them was one of Pyrrhon \u2019s AIs. It was this old thing that stored records for her back when she was still creating gen3 clones and it was basically used as an archiver. However Pyrrhon lost the need to use it and destroyed it. \u2026 not really, though, since it\u2019s alive and actively leaking things onto the internet now. The AI is a replica of Pyrrhon and so is initially built to eliminate all threats to humanity\u2019s future. So here are the possible ways it can be defeated Savior\u2019s dilemma The AI is built to eliminate all threats to humanity\u2019s future , but TLH forces it to identify itself as a threat They expose a contradiction: 1. If the AI controls the laser, it has the power to destroy the world. 2. If it has the power to destroy the world, it is the greatest risk to humanity. 3. If it is a risk to humanity, it must eliminate itself. The AI, following its core directive, is forced into an endless loop of trying to delete itself while still trying to \u201cfix\u201d the future. Eventually, the logical contradiction locks up the AI\u2019s processes completely , freezing it into inaction before a final forced shutdown Paradox bomb TLH inserts a corrupted data set into the AI\u2019s system that contradicts its own history . For example, the AI has records of past events , but they feed it data that claims the exact opposite happened . The AI, relying on logical consistency, tries to reconcile both realities \u2014but cannot . Unable to resolve which timeline is \u201ctrue,\u201d the AI fragments into chaos , creating an infinite processing loop that overheats its system and destroys itself Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Shutdown The AI is wired into the laser , but TLH rigs a failsafe that will randomly either shut it down or let it live \u2014and the AI knows this . However, until the program executes, the AI cannot determine its own fate. Since it cannot predict the outcome , it cannot take action without * risking its own destruction The AI spirals into decision paralysis , unable to interfere because any choice could lead to its demise. It shuts itself down in a desperate attempt to \"pause\" reality and prevent the unknown. \u201dwhat\u2019s the Laser?\u201d *later on in the story, the MC\u2019s discover a laser. It\u2019s extremely powerful, and could easily wipe out FUTURE (where clones are produced). However, the various pieces to it are scattered across the world and protected by particularly dangerous clones (Ie [Phi](../../Characters/NPCs/Other clones/Phi.md), [Mutilation](../../Characters/Bosses/Mutilation.md), [Honeycakes](../../Characters/Playable Characters/Honeycakes.md), etc.) and so, that creates the gameplay. the AI is there to tie the MCs together and to give them initial relations. Except for Honeycakes who appears at the very end. The AI leads them to the laser which is the real meat and potatoes of the game. Chapter 1: DEMOlition reel cutscene through the city It\u2019s a 3d animated cutscene that is like a drone shot that goes through buildings, above buildings, through people\u2019s workplaces and such. Eventually, it hovers behind Nea, who gets into her apartment. Room 404. Nea opens her computer up Her room is kind of a mess. clothes strewn everywhere. Sheets on the floor. Vibrator on the bed. All sorts of things. Her eyes scan the computer and the new email she received Focus on the eyes here, you can see the reflection of the email vaguely in the first shot. Then, cut to the \u201cactual email\u201d which is just snippets of text like NEA and BOUNTY and (ins amount here) and APT.404. Nea receives a notification on her phone New bounty: NEA V. AHMAD: (ins amount) Banging at the door. Draft The opener is no cutscene, but instead Nea running through the forest from the nearby fire from the temple. You can fight a few things, and it teaches you how. Upon completion, she stares at the temple. It\u2019s great, next scene is her working a 9-5 office job. She gets FIRED!!! Like a cut from the fucking burning fire looking at the temple, and then her hacking away at a computer \u201c\u2026 This is boring. I should get coffee later.\u201d You walk out of the office to go to the cafe and all her stuff is just fucking thrown at her while she gets a coffee. \u201cCongrats! You\u2019re fired.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026. Thanks.\u201d \u201cNo this is serious we did a background check and we found that you\u2014\u201c (Nea runs out) \u201c\u2014\u2026 were involved in a .. major historical fire, and\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 she\u2019s gone! After her!\u201d This is the tutorial sequence that you can die from, in an office building. Nea eventually jumps out of the window and lands on a car. It swerves and throws her into a nearby alleyway. Nea gets up and wipes the mud off of her. Here, she meets a pi-bot who was alerted. This is because she literally landed on its car. You also crushed her head in, so.. just take her CORE. You are given a perma core and instructed to go out to the forest. at this time, you can explore more of the caves. This is the first area, congrats! The city is closed off because there are guards looking for a \u2018runaway worker\u2019. Wonder who that is! It is also the afternoon, and things will be different in the nighttime. They tell you to defeat enemies (plants) to be able to survive the night. It\u2019s nighttime. A lever opens for a room near the entrance. When you enter, You see a blue Stickfig who appeared behind you. This is Gamma! She tosses her cig on the ground and activates her weapons. Insert dialogue here. Secondary boss, that you\u2019re healed from! So this is where you\u2019re introduced to physical damage and magic damage. While Nea is much weaker to physical damage, Gamma is weak to magic damage. If only you could get a special move in\u2026 Gamma\u2019s pride is hurt when you \u2018defeat her\u2019, so she just leaves. There is a waterfall in the next room over. You can rest there. There is also a fridge where you can save LMFAO dont ask me why its there. The city is still being guarded so you have no choice but to find the NPC which gives you a small map, and defeat more enemies because its absurdly expensive. (Joke) You also don\u2019t have to, you can also just go to the end of the map, where you spot Prodigal from a distance. You follow him. From there, you see Gamma. She\u2019s laying on the ground with a power bank in her hands. You can pick it up, and also pick her up too. When you take it, something rumbles in the distance. a bomb is thrown\u2014 PRODIGAL!! Gamma shoots up. She suddenly collapses onto Nea. You \u2018put her into your inventory\u2019 LMFAOOGAHEHA You run with Gamma out the forest (it\u2019s just your normal sprite) and into the next area, where you flick a lever to stop her. shift to a small campfire that Gamma made. They talk for a bit. \u201cOh.. so you\u2019re from the temples? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d Gamma joins your party . Also, the city is open again. You can go there when youre done exploring. Upon entering the city\u2026 CTSCNE She spots a guy on the street. G \u201cNea, launch me.\u201d N \u201cWh-what?!\u201d G \u201dNEA, LAUNCH ME!\u201d Nea launches her towards that guy. She tackles him to the ground. Nea\u2019s about to sob her eyes out, but oh! That\u2019s actually her little brother, Constantine. G \u201cyou little fucker! What\u2019re you doin here?!?! Heheh!! C \u201cGa-Gamma..!\u201d C \u201cWhat the fuck?! I thought you were Prodigal!!\u201d G \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you moved here!! How\u2019re ya doin, Const?\u201d C \u201cTerrible, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d G \u201cVery funny Constantine. So, you\u2019re still the engineer, right?\u201d C \u201cUh oh, what is it this time?\u201d Gamma holds the CORE up to Constantine. Nea finally catches up to them, gasping for air. Constantine\u2019s eyes light up. C \u201cI have an extra room.\u201d Constantine is like, \u201cyeah one of you can take this CORE; it\u2019ll power yours up and give you a temporary buff. I think Gamma doesn\u2019t deserve it, so why don\u2019t you take it, Nea?\u201d (Gamma starts beating him up /j). He says you can pay him back later with the Danari you collect from enemies. Starting guide: I want There\u2019s this gang of animal-like people. They\u2019re actually trying to revive a dead religion and all believe that they are one with the spirits of their warrior ancestors. They are not. Gamma and Nea seek freedom To disrupt Pyrrhon\u2019s control, which seems impossible. MAYBE go back to the video game plot; the one where Pyrrhon is self aware They will do this by constructing the ULTIMATE CORE! Using theft Trading/bartering At first: nea is fired whatergver Brawl with Gamma \u201cFuck you!\u201d \u201cFuck you!\u201d Get lost in forest. \u201cOh it\u2019s you\u201d. Gamma and Nea meet from a peace treaty. Instead of Prodigal, they are initially followed by Commander Vee. He wants to kill both of them simply to raise his hierarchal status. \u201cWhat luck, that I\u2019d find two beautiful girls, all trapped in here like this! Come now!\u201d Nea: this guy got me fired! Gamma: this guy got me fired! They run away and he\u2019s really mad so he chases them around. Now: Run around to get information and more gear Ok so they hide under the bar tables when Vee shows up to the slaughterhouse. They see how he threatens Shenx and brags about how he can leave this useless slum anytime he wants, and he has a home up there in the heavens. It\u2019s fact checked by Gamma\u2014 he does! They now want to kill him to get that. However they have no fuckin idea where he is. This guy\u2019s all bark no bite.. if we can get ahold of his stuff, we\u2019d be rich beyond belief! We gotta kill this guy! \u201cYou might wanna talk to your brother, Gamma.\u201d \u201cH-huh?! How\u2019d you\u2014?!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve (shnx and const) been friends for decades. \u2018Course I know who you are.\u201d Nea: (Maybe this girl is useful. Hah). Constantine is over in (Baguio!) Cue them being productive and encountering a few sidequests: Eskalion\u2019s attack patterns ATK one: Starts from one side of the stage, and runs at you at blinding speeds. It\u2019ll damage you if you\u2019re in the middle of it. He teleports and reappears above you and does one of two things A) he will shoot DIRECTLY BELOW HIM B) he will shoot to both corners of the room. Then he will disappear and reappear either grabbing at the walls or on the ground, preparing to fight again. If he\u2019s on the wall, he will shoot in your general direction four times, teleport behind you, (he will linger so you can counter or move away), and swing. The swing is really big, but so is his cooldown. If he\u2019s on the ground, he can: shoot at you with his gun jump up (From jumping up, he can either guard and reflect all bullets back at the player, OR he can throw a bomb. It basically goes in a straight line and can go as far as like, 25% of the room. So from the starting point (when he throws it) and when it ends, it bounces three times. Then, it\u2019ll explode into large pillars which reach to the top of the room). lunge again At 25% health, he\u2019ll crawl up to the top of the room, and swing around on a chandelier. He will shoot at you hysterically and you can\u2019t deal any damage, so you just have to avoid it or guard. After that, he\u2019s in a ravenous state and has increased speed, but lowered defense. His atk is much much higher thoughSo after this you probably get an introduction to Constantine and CORE buffs. End Once he dies, I\u2019ll initiate Prodigal/Balach\u2019s arc, HORRAY! So upon death, he crawls over to the wall, while Gamma puts a gun in his head. He starts rambling incoherently about \u201cGod\u2019s divine Will\u201d, \u201crevenge\u201d, \u201cthe Goddess\u201d, and other nonsensical religious bullshit. He then lets out a final plea of himself being a prophet or whatever, general religious psychosis talk. Then, he reaches out to the wall, and presses a big red button (which was once enclosed in a glass container). After that, the windows all shatter, and Prodigal jumps in. Vee starts talking to her and asks if she\u2019s proud of him, but she just shoots him. Gamma and Nea are frozen in fear. Prodigal ignores them, and throws his limp body across the room, like a child playing with a toy. She then rips his head off and plays with his entrails. Yay! The screen blacks out and Prodigal is gone, Gamma and Nea both passed out. All that\u2019s left is black goop and Vee\u2019s gun, which you can take and use. Now, Gamma and Nea were trying to kill Vee so that they could get his ID shard, fake his identity, and rob him and the other corpos + get into restricted areas. However Prodigal broke it. Lmfao. Anyway the cops start to show up, so a cutscene plays where they just run out of the building.That\u2019s the end of the chapter. So there\u2019s a huge explosion and Gamma and Nea are blown away. They both wake up seeing Honey, but they dont know who she is. She drops them on the ground, flicks over a business card, then leaves. Cut to the Baguio place festival. Gamma is looking. ok basically if you go to Prodigal, you go to the Akira collesum It\u2019s basically dogtown. \u201cRumor has it, it\u2019s completely outta Pyrrhon\u2019s control. Being in No Man\u2019s Land, an\u2019 everything\u2026 bet ya haven\u2019t heard of it, huh? Let me show ya \u2018round.\u201d \u201dexcuse you! Everyone knows about this place.\u201d \u201cYeah.. I\u2019ve only heard rumors.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s.. oddly quiet.\u201d \u201dYeah, no merchants jumping out, huh? Hah. Guess if yer here, you\u2019re here coz ya know what you want. They don\u2019t need to sell you nothin\u2019. They got corpos an\u2019 war criminals, all in one place.\u201d \u201dHuh..\u201d \u201dHeard you could get up to the space station if you had enough money.. well, you can get anything if you have enough money.\u201d (Cue guy selling organs) \u201d\u2026 uh huh. So, who are we lookin\u2019 for, again?\u201d (Point). PREDEM II FINAL DUNGEON The lives we\u2019ve left behind And whatever God is left for us. \u201cThe factory\u2019s been abandoned for some time now. But it started pumping out materials again!\u201d \u201cHuh? What is the factory? Well, it was from the RAPTURE, it\u2019s got some of Pyrrhon\u2019s old radiators. If someone tries hard enough, they could make a bomb, but\u2014..\u201d \u201cH-hey!! Where are you two rascals going?!\u201d \u201cThis is it,\u201d Says Nea. \u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d Says Gamma. Get in the side scroller mode for a period of time and hijack a ship entering from the factory. Fight through it with the terrain changing due to the changes in altitude. You play as Gamma first when they agree to split up. You go through a large wave of enemies and hit the button to stop the power flow, but the ship still goes. It\u2019s up to Nea. Cutscene of Nea running along the side of the ship and into Balach\u2019s chamber. Follow him through a third wave in the storage cavity. \u201cHAHAHAH\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re pathetic, Nea!\u201d \u201cJust try to find me!\u201d you can\u2019t actually find him. Break through the door and walk through it, and get pinned to the ground by Balach. \u201cHah..!\u201d each line of dialogue takes off like, 10% of your remaining HP. \u201cLook at you! Pathetic!\u201d \u201cYOU took EVERYTHING from me!\u201d \u201cHahhah.. hahah .. look at you,\u201d \u201cWEAK!! YOU\u2019RE WEAK, NEA!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you are. A fuckin mindless puppet of your father.\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE HIDEOUS!\u201d Balach kicks her. Nea\u2019s HP falls to 0. \u201cHah..\u201d \u201cFutile, as always.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my end goal with you.\u201d Balach flicks a switch which turns on a screen on top of every single school, temple, and family. \u201cYou see, Nea?\u201d \u201cHahah. You didn\u2019t even know.\u201d \u201cNow, your CORE\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one powerful enough besides myself.\u201d \u201cHeheh..\u201d \u201cWait here, whore .\u201d Balach leaves. Nea rolls over and regenerates one HP. He walks in and nudges her with his foot. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re still awake?\u201d \u201cI should\u2019ve killed you, all those years ago.\u201d \u201cYou and your father.\u201d \u201cHah.\u201d \u201cRemember that day? You remember it well.\u201d \u201cI did plan on Pyrrhon. What I didn\u2019t plan on was his suicide. And you .\u201d \u201cThat CORE,\u201d He grabs Nea\u2019s chest. \u201cThat CORE is mine .\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cGive it up, Nea. Give it to me.\u201d Nea limply falls, but says one thing: \u201c\u2026 You killed him?\u201d Balach doesn\u2019t listen and takes out a knife. Nea grabs it. \u201cDad..\u201d \u201c...\u201d \u201cMy dad...\u201d Congrats to you and Nea for unlocking her secondary ULT!!~ ULT: BLOOD DRIVE is now active! Nea gathers all the blood seeped into the floor and revives herself with it. Whether enemy or stick, it\u2019s hers now. She fights Balach again, who\u2019s basically a dummy. He goes through the same cycle but you just deal infinitely more damage than he does. You chase after him and break all his shields until you pummel him into the ground, like the real ground, since youre in the sky. The dust settles. He\u2019s nothing but a CORE. Nea looks around. She\u2019s right next to a body of water, and a mysteriously burnt pillar. A nearby old and wet paper drifts in the wind. Versailles.. Nea crushes Balach\u2019s CORE, And falls asleep. Gamma falls to the ground in a nearby parachute, picks Nea up, and walks home. End of act one. From Now on Our primary goals after chapter One is character development and slower plot progression. CHARA GOAL: Focus on Gamma or Nea or Honey or Python Choice, can be done in any order. DRIVING FORCE End goal: stop Pyrrhon. Short term: Grow Stronger get PB CORE\u2019s for story progression. Stars EQ \u201cThere are five total maj chords we need in order to weaken Pyrrhon and nullify her core output. They\u2019re here.\u201d After all that, they get the goal and have one final life-changing event, then leads into the finale. Act 2: The Arena. I had a thought.. Now, CORE has a cool mechanic where you do not kill a single enemy. You knock them out. They will infinitely respawn once you take too long and until you reach the next area. You don\u2019t have to kill them, but you will get more rewards from the more you do. \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 is a rule Nea and Gamma stand by, since they\u2019re mostly fighting clones and Nea is obligated from religion. It goes something like this. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since Balach\u2019s death and Nea\u2019s evolution. She\u2019s still recovering from the magic overload. She\u2019s fine, I guess. Since we\u2019re alone, I\u2019ll tell ya, I\u2019m kinda jealous. I wish I could be as good as her. I wish I was useful. Goddamnit, look at the time! My food\u2019s ready! See ya later!\u201c CTSCNE Honeycakes swings a fish onto the table and begins to skin it. Chasmus takes the chopped pieces from earlier and pours it into a pot. Han takes a finished plate and carries it out. From above, Prodigal and Lane snicker. Prodigal reaches down to take the plate. Han looks around, confused. Chasmus looks angry and Han looks back, sheepishly. Prodigal hands the kebab to Lane, who eats it happily and giggles. They kick their feet off the roof and gaze off into the sky. Camera shifts and fades into the upper left. Khan is sharpening his sword from atop a mountain. Python is starting a nearby fire out of old parts and notices the town. The fireworks explode. Gamma and Nea walk through the town. \u201cHeheh! I told ya!\u201d \u201cWhatever, sure! Heh. Ow!!\u201d \u201cOops, sorry. I had this idea\u2026 Honey and Gamma become friends, almost immediately. It\u2019s quick, like a gust of wind. They talk, inside the restaurant. It\u2019s a dog eat dog world out there, they both know. Gamma says, \u201cDude, if I were rich, I\u2019d go up into the stars.. You know, the interplanetary cities? We can live it up there. Hah! \u2018s impossible though, we\u2019re stuck down here.\u201d Honey, \u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as you think. Networking\u2019s mostly what it comes to.\u201d Honey pulls out a pouch from underneath the couch cushions. I have a CORE so unbelievably powerful, it could stop Pyrrhon in her tracks, easy. The power\u2019s unregulated\u2014 one of her own. You could use this to get to the stars, easy. people would bow to you. You\u2019d be at her level. However This CORE is not yet complete. This CORE is the project of fifteen groups of people, just like you. Hundreds of thousands.. I\u2019ve lost count. There\u2019s too many. My days of fighting are over. I do not seek revenge. But you two\u2026 \u2026 Should you so desire, the next part of the CORE is located in the mountain. It is supplying a group of undead AI who named themselves \u201c The Datura .\u201d \u2026 If you must, I ask you proceed with caution. I don\u2019t want you to end up like everyone else. Gamma takes it at an almost comical speed. Honey laughs sadly. \u201cTo get up the mountain, you must go through hordes of CORES and AI. You have to travel through a forest which not even I have progressed.\u201d Gamma stops her. \u201cThen so be it! We don\u2019t make any difference here anyway!! We either live or live long enough to be killed, and if I even have the chance to make a difference, then why would I give that up?! I\u2019ll be killed, that\u2019s it. Yeah, I know! But, if I can at least\u2026\u201d Nea looks down, ashamed. Honey hesitates. \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a passion much like yours anymore, much less in a clone .\u201d Gamma stands up. \u201cBeing a clone doesn\u2019t mean jackshit! If yer here ta just rail on me for bein\u2019 one, then\u2014!\u201d \u201cTch!\u201d Honey stands up and forces her down. \u201cAll this this and that that yer goin\u2019 on about! Calm down!\u201d Gamma and Nea glance at each other awkwardly. \u201cWhat I mean ,\u201d Honey says. \u201cIs you\u2019ve got a heart. Not a great thing, but not a bad thing, either.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d Honey rubs her temples. \u201cI.. You two..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 are absolutely insufferable!! \u201d Honey groans. \u201cPack up! We\u2019re leaving tomorrow!\u201d Nea stiffens. \u201cWh-what?!\u201d \u201cYou heard me! Hey, Han! Get \u2018em a room! Chasmus, take it outta my check. I got work ta do, go pack up an\u2019 get up!\u201d \u201cw-we already have a\u2014\u201d \u201cLOCK \u2018EM UP!!!\u201d \u2026 So Gamma and Nea sleep for the night, and are awoken at 3 AM by Honeycakes. \u201cc\u2019mon! this is baby work!\u201d Honey swings her hammer over her shoulder. \u201cY\u2019all are pathetic! Overthrowing a world leader and ya can\u2019t even get up? C\u2019mon!\u201d \u2026 And they go to the mountain. CTSNE of Honey breaking down the rusty gates leading up. Gamma laughs. \u201cDamn! we\u2019ve got nothin ta worry about, huh?\u201d She puts her arms behind her head. \u201cWith that , you can even rival Omega!\u201d \u201c\u2026 The one who beat up Pyrrhon?\u201d Gamma nods. Nea perks up. \u201cY-yeah! they were the same color as you, Gamma!\u201d \u201cGen 3 clone!\u201d Gamma puffs up her chest. \u201cWe\u2019re the last sentient clones around coz of him! Hah!\u201d Honey scratches the back of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something to brag about.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d Gamma says, \u201cWhat Division were you? I was 12.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Honey says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to bash in skulls, not talk about your tragic backstory! Hurry up!!\u201d Stage 1 \u2014 Honey You play as Gamma and Nea for a bit until you get to a puzzle that only Honey can do. she chastises them and plows through it for them. You get to play as just her for the rest of the level, which isn\u2019t very much. Should be medium difficulty of more puzzles and exploration with minimal fighting until the end. Precision platforming Stage 2 \u2014 The Datura Small fighting sequence with the Datura AI. Gamma complains that they\u2019re stronger than usual and Honey snaps that it\u2019s the CORE. If it\u2019s the CORE you wanna get, it\u2019s the CORE you must defeat! This stage is more of a fighting stage than the last. After the first wave, you explore a small maze to heal, then fight a secondary wave. Stage 3 \u2014 Rattlesnake in the flowers Woah, the CORE is right there, unguarded! No, no it\u2019s not. Python\u2019s guarding it. Nea screams, exasperated. \u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?\u201d Honeycakes grips her hammer. \u201cWe\u2019re going after her!\u201d The walls suddenly begin to close in (they\u2019re indoors) and it\u2019s a speed precision race to the end of the level. If you do a secret level you can get Gamma\u2019s motorcycle Stage 4 \u2014 Python RUH roh it\u2019s the Datura again!!! You bash in a round until you encounter Python. Insert conversation Python boss fight obtain bit of CORE! \u201cIs that it?\u201d Asks Gamma. Honey shakes her head. \u201cNope. That bitch ass cut it up. Looks like the Datura got some. Let\u2019s kill em!\u201d Stage 5 \u2014 Venom Python again :skull: Gamma says, \u201cLeave us alone! We don\u2019t want nothing with you!\u201d Python Points towards Honey: \u201cIt\u2019s not you two I want.\u201d Honey/Python conflict G: H-hold on! Honey can\u2019t\u2014.. That .. Omega\u2019s a clone! Honey-Honey.. she\u2019s\u2014 P: and how do you think she obtained such a high power weapon? She hasn\u2019t worked with the temples to obtain magic, right, Nea? N: \u2026 P: And Gamma, your fists, they\u2019re magic, aren\u2019t they? G: but\u2026 P: And what does that make you, Honeycakes? Non-religious magic possessor? H: \u2026 H: \u2026 H: \u2026 It\u2019s been a while, Python. G: Honey\u2014?! (Honey swings out her hammer) P: Ah? I save your life, and this is the thanks I get?! H: Tch! P: A murderer, that\u2019s what you always were! Just take out my CORE like you never even knew me in the first place! I dare you! P: and you.. you\u2019ve got a following, don\u2019t you now? P: Hah.. hahah\u2026 you\u2019re probably lying to them, too huh?! P: PATHETIC!! P: Come on, Honey! P: Life\u2019s just a game, right?! Isn\u2019t that what you told me?! P: SO WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH FIGHTING TIL MY DEATH?!?! Battle start Something something. Fight her. Something else. Fight the Datura This is possibly the hardest fight here then. Well after that fiasco (survive long enough, lol. You can\u2019t defeat every single enemy, it\u2019s an endless wave until the timer runs out) and an unskippable death plays out. They are separated by Khan , with the last piece of the CORE, who comes to fully activate it. The blow upon activation is so insanely powerful that: Honey and Gamma are blown away Nea and Python are blown away. Chasmus is left alone. Stage 6 \u2014 Memory Cards Nea, Lane, Const, and Prodigal. Gamma and Nea wake up in a dingy alleyway in a common city. As they start to walk around, Nea gets a splitting headache and falls tot he ground. G: \u201cN\u2014.. Nea?! Are you okay?!\u201d N: \u201cGh .. damn\u2014.. damn fuckin\u2019 w.. ah..\u201d G: \u201c Oh.. Right, CORE density is much higher here.\u201d G: \u201cD-don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll get you somewhere safe!!\u201d N: \u201cI-.. I\u2019m sorry..\u201d Gamma hefts Nea on her back Oh shit it\u2019s Lane and Prodigal!! Prodigal kidnaps gamma, and leaves Nea on the ground. Cue quickly moving stage with hard obstacles. After the stage, small cutscene of Nea spying on Prodigal and her group (Lock, Lane, and Conte) and dragging Gamma away like a spider in a web. Nea tries to sneak out, but is caught by Conte and Lock who do a combo attack and kick her out. Cue Constantine They catch her as she falls. They\u2019d gone to D4 for business, but for some reason caught a nerualink of Gamma and decided to come over. Constantine is here to deliver a USB of blackmail to someone in the underworld. \u201cWell, what are you guys wanting for?!\u201d Nea points towards the giant building Prodigal ran off to. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Gamma!\u201d This dungeon.. is incredibly long! 4 waves of enemies, and 2 waves of puzzle. The first puzzle wave is just for entering the building, the other one is for getting to the 4th wave and then Prodigal. 2nd wave is more complicated. Each wave includes a different challenge (ie consistent bleed, projectiles, immobilized, more projectiles but it\u2019s bigger). At the end, they get into a glass elevator and go up to the sky. You can vaguely see the conflict with Khan, Python, and Honey, but they pay it no mind. When you finish, cut to Gamma. You walk out of your cage, and into an eerily quiet hallway. You find yourself back in Future, trying to escape. It\u2019s actually almost impossible to lose here; you have almost infinite health and deal insane damage. Upon reaching the end, you fall down onto Earth, look up, and\u2014! Oh, it\u2019s just Prodigal. You\u2019re tied up against a wall and she\u2019s staring at you intently. A bad robotic voice asks, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d Prodigal slams her fist the wall beside Gamma. \u201cDo you remember? What we did?\u201d \u201cAll those years..\u201d \u201cDo you remember Who helped you escape from Future?\u201d Do you remember anything? Nea and Constantine break in from the ceiling and throw Lock and Conte off the sides. Prodigal tries to escape through the ceiling, but Honey throws her down. Constantine gets Gamma off of the wall and Shenx looks around. And shit goes down. It basically escalates to puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal \u2192 puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal again, with Gamma 4life required. During the first puzzle, Lane says, \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her!!\u201d And once she is defeated, Prodigal takes her and runs away. During the second puzzle, Lane tries again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take her away from me!!\u201d But she ends up falling to the ground. Prodigal asks one more time. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d Gamma slides back and spits blood onto the ground \u201cHell no!\u201d Prodigal jams her against the wall and presses her thumb into Gamma\u2019s forehead When Gamma fell in future, she saw Pyrrhon, who held a gun. She also saw Prodigal. She remembers prodigal. Flashbacks of how Prodigal helped her before, helped her fight, Pyrrhon says, \u201cnight night~\u201d And the video glitches to black. Prodigal asks. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d The conversation Gamma: \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Gamma: \u201cAre you pleased with yourself?\u201d Gamma: \u201cDo you enjoy killing everybody in sight? Do you get some sorta sick high off of seeing people scream and cry and\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d .. You win.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing I lost.. Everything..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. What\u2019s left of me?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing that she\u2014\u201c Prodigal: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cThe consequences are far too great for me to return home empty handed.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease allow me to have this one thing. The only freedom I\u2019ll ever get.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI lost.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win, okay?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d [Gamma\u2019s hands fall to her side]. Prodigal: \u201c.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you can\u2019t- can\u2019t ever forgive me, but..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI have to thank you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI found you.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy sole reason for existence.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTo find you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma, you..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAs much as you hated me, I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t stand how they treated you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou remember, right? The cloning facility.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cA clone of my being..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d And yet, human despite it all.\u201d Prodigal: \u201d I couldn\u2019t let them take that away from you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cHahah. You ran away from me, didn\u2019t you? I was the reason you\u2019re here now with your scars and burnt edges.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you hated me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just\u2014..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c(shiver, cough)\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just really..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I can spend my last moments with you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy little sister..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cOhh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cH-hey\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPut my metal carcass of a soul to good use, okay?\u201d Gamma: \u201cPuh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProdigal, you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease just\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201cProdigal, are you\u2014!?\u201d [Prodigal flops down on the floor]. Prodigal: \u201c.. Please.\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhat are you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cShe took you away from me, and I\u2014\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. Your pitiful expression, that day..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt was too much for me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong for God to save me now.\u201d [Gamma grabs Prodigal\u2019s hand] Gamma: \u201cProdigal just\u2014!..\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhy\u2014.. Why couldn\u2019t you have\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201cYOU IDIOT!\u201d [Gamma slams the ground] Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!\u201d Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDNT YOU\u2014?!\u201d (Gamma wipes away tears) Gamma: \u201cI.. I could\u2019ve saved you, Prodigal..! I-I thought that\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI never hated you.\u201d Gamma: \u201cI know. I know but why\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201c.. Why coulnd\u2019t you have told me?\u201d Gamma: \u201cSo that I\u2014.\u201d Gamma: \u201c.. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cLook at you now.\u201d [Prodigal lifts a shaking hand onto Gamma\u2019s chest or hand] Prodigal: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d [Prodigal laughs quietly] Prodigal: \u201cOh, Gamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIf only I\u2014..\u201d Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. can spend my last moments..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cwith you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy baby sister..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProd-.. PRODIGAL?!\u201d Prodigal fucking SHOOTS herself Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL! WAKE UP! PRODIGAL! PRODIGAL!\u201d [Gamma shakes Prodigal frantically, but her core flies out]. Prodigal faded away into the night, melting away with the distant summer sun. The only fading memory of Prodigal, her CORE, the very bane of her existence, rests in Gamma\u2019s bloodied hands. \u2026 Gamma equips Prodigal\u2019s CORE. \u2026 \u2026 Lane shows up beside Gamma, and stares at Prodigal\u2019s empty carcass. A slash, and Lane is also nothing but a desecrated corpse. \u2026 \u2026 Nea reconvenes with Gamma, who is still, and can\u2019t move. She hugs Gamma, who passes out upon touch. \u2026 \u2026 Honey\u2019s CORE is one half fuller. Prodigal had the third piece. \u2026 \u2026 Act 3: The Hive Crossing Over the Line Refresh your memory, or when you wanna be, the Phantom\u2019s on the way, She\u2019s coming down the street. Summer lights, seems to me, I\u2019m in a dream. This summer night\u2026 Huangzhi Khan, Python, Honey, Kai, and The Avatar . Back at the Slaughterhouse, Gamma\u2019s finally woken back up. She doesn\u2019t seem to feel like talking, but says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d anyway. the CORE\u2019s one half fuller. two more chunks to go. One is with Python, the other with someone else however, the conflict with Prodigal brought Honey\u2019s CORE to the attention of Pyrrhon, who set off after them. As they leave The Slaughterhouse, Gamma, Nea, and Honey are tracked down by police and chased. if you get caught it\u2019s a game over\u2014 you have to run to the next town over before they give up. This town is similar to a beehive. They throw a man to the ground as they go and he is shot down by police. Due to Honey\u2019s mass amount of strength, she is mistaken for a temple leader and is whisked away. Gamma and Nea are left alone. Follow Honey, she tries to fight but is put down by what looks like DGM CROW\u2019s talismans. Turns out the guy that they killed at the entrance was a high level temple leader\u2026 Nea has a panic attack as she realizes he died (shot by police). They currently mistake Honey to be that man. He didn\u2019t have a determinable gender so they just say she\u2019s a girl. she makes up a bullshit response which is obviously fake but fucking works anyway. You learn a small bit of her past through a flashback. Gamma and Nea sneak into her room via the window at the top of her ceiling. She\u2019s happy! At this time, you can now do side quests in this town. it\u2019s recommended you do at least one so you can unlock the inns and shops in this town. When they go outside, Honey sees Python. She summons her hammer ready to strike\u2014 She holds a small girl by her ponytail, and plugs the CORE into her. ??? \u201c\u2026 P\u2014.. Python..?\u201d P \u201cShh.. shh, you\u2019re still weak. Are you okay?\u201d ??? \u201cMy-my master, he\u2014..\u201d P \u201cshh.. it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay.\u201d ??? \u201cP-Python, I\u2014.. I\u2019m so sorry, y-you..\u201d P \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. It wasn\u2019t that hard, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Python puts her injured arm behind her back and continues to stroke the girl\u2019s head. \u2026 \u2026 You can choose to still attack Python or not Attacked The bad ending. You strike, and Python flinches. You have struck the girl and killed her. Python stares at the girl in tears. H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201dYou-..\u201d H \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Honey.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d a DDLC esque glitch sequence sends Honey back to her room. Knock Knock Knock, Honey\u2019s woken up by guns. Gamma and Nea are nowhere to be found. She prioritizes herself and runs out of a really fucking dangerous dungeon outside of the town. She slips and falls suddenly, and someone puts their feet on her back. Huangzhi says, \u201cI got her. Take her in.\u201d The police show up, lead by Python. the CORE is implemented into her , embedded in to her back. \u201c\u2026 Police, dismiss. I will handle her.\u201d they disperse. \u201dThis is our fight, Honey.\u201d \u201dWill you fight me, or die like a dog?\u201d The hardest boss fight in the game starts here, lol. it\u2019s kind of impossible to win and it generally just encourages you to go show mercy to Python, the longer route. If you manage to beat her with just Honey on two lives, you wrench the CORE out of her back and kill her. Python is dead, but the CORE is 25% fuller. you return to the town like nothing happened. Mercy The good ending. You just get up and leave. Nearby guards ask Honey if she saw an intruder, but she declines. P. \u201c\u2026\u201d H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P. \u201cThanks.\u201d Python leaves with the girl. She leaves behind a really good weapon upgrader. Alright, so! You return back to your room. You might want to add more stuff in here. So you go into the hallway: Khan, and a few other people are there. While you try to refuse walking into the room, they refuse you.. haha. They talk to Honey and vaguely hint that they know who she is. When her fingers inch towards her Kendama, they tie her up immidletly and throw her at the bottom of an arena. Huangzhi sits there with Khan, twirling a key. \u201cGo.\u201d All of the NPCs from the town or temple attack you. When you get closer\u2026 Khan takes the CORE off of the pedestal, and then inserts it into a little boy. He attacks Honey. After winning (or, \u2018winning\u2019), Honey is thrown back and almost gets hit, until the attack is blocked\u2026 \u201cJust like old times, huh?\u201d It\u2019s Python! Similarly to the Ummu fight, she assists you. After the fight, there\u2019s a looong scene of an explosion. You seem to have won, the temple is in shambles, and no one can be seen. And then a missile is shot into Python\u2019s back. You have two seconds to press \u201cx\u201d to grab. if you don\u2019t, then the (INSERT GANG HERE) will attack you. if you do, they will stop and provide healing every now and then. That\u2019s the only difference it has. You catch a mild glimpse of PYRRHON. She saw you. She knows Honey runs with Python through the forest while being chased by Pyrrhon, who runs at lightspeed. Honey is thrown off of a cliff\u2014 She starts to fall, is this how it ends? I never even got to meet my mother, I never even got to.. I worked so hard.. is this the life I get? her hands are grabbed by Python, who\u2019s leaning off of a boat controlled by Gamma and Nea. She\u2019s hoisted onto the boat and runs off. As they hop back on land, the boat crashes but no one pays it any mind. A gang of bandits suddenly come out with knives. Gamma and Nea step forward to protect Honey. \u201cStand down\u201d, says Python. \u201cIt\u2019s solved.\u201d There\u2019s a group of groans and they all walk away. \u201cYou were going to AMBUSH me?!\u201d \u201cI DIDN\u2019T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO REACT!!\u2019 \u201cREACT TO WHAT?!?!?!?\u201d Gamma and Nea look at each other and sigh. Camera pan. Python sits atop the cliff, and gestures Khan away. Huangzhi later comes over, but he is thrown into the ocean. End of act 3. End of act three. Act 4: Late Loves Lamentations The world\u2019s on fire. After the HIVE, Nea and Gamma go to a nearby cave where they see Rhaika Lei making a campfire and meditating. You can rest with him. Upon interacting with him, he just opens one of his eyes, but says nothing, and goes back to normal. Behind him, there\u2019s a door you can go into. It\u2019s a gorgeous place, reminiscent of an old Catholic Church. At the center, there\u2019s a small statue and sword that is embedded into the chest of a small girl. It\u2019s a human girl. This is a cutscene. You can take it out, but Rhaika Lei will rush in and throw a dagger at your face. He doesn\u2019t talk again, but you do duke it out again. If you win, he staggers back. He chokes on his own words. You pull out the sword. \u201cWho dares disturb my slumber?\u201d Blah blah blah. Rhaika Lei spits out a black glob, which manifests itself into a spider and crawls into the statue. He starts coughing and sputtering. It\u2019s then that the statues eyes light up, and you\u2019re trapped in a dungeon, congrats. There\u2019s a broken fridge in there which flickers to life. You have to pay though. lol. Rhaika Lei is unconscious beside you, but he\u2019s holding a USB which you can insert into a cyborg. It details the tale of Kei, Kai, and Pyrrhon\u2019s conquest against God. It brings into question that there is more than known. Rhaika Lei snaps the USB out of you, then runs away. When you see him next, he\u2019s inserted it into an old mech, which he tries to use to fight you, but is stricken down by Kai, who descends down. \u201cThere is no need for your services, Rhaika Lei. You have done well. And you four\u2026 why have you summoned me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cYou expelled a curse for..?\u201d \u201cFor fun.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d Kai slumps down. \u201c\u2026 Do you need my help?\u201d \u201cYeah, wanna stop a world leader with us?\u201d Gamma jokes. Kai laughs and says sure. As the party member screen opens, it\u2019s cut in half. Kai is sputtering for breath. Her blood leaks into Rhaika Lei\u2019s dead corpse. Prequel Story + LORE (my first draft,, i lost the other one) XD It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Earth, in 2XXX. 2012, God fell from the heavens. Angels crashed and burned, and all left behind in the slaughter was a small, gleaning green gem. That\u2019s the PRODIGAL CORE, rumored to be the Core of life itself, the heart of God Himself. From the \u201crapture\u201d, as it was called, 75% of Earth was wiped out. 75% of Earth is \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d, and 25% is all under control of Pyrrhon . Pyrrhon\u2019s the maniacal maniac who harnessed the full power of the PRODIGAL CORE and brought Earth from the depths of hell: for a cost. All you need to know is now, Pyrrhon is in complete and total control of earth and its inhabitants. She runs \u201cOZ\u201d, the world IS OZ. There may be a government, but OZ holds so much power that they are completely powerless. Should OZ be brought down, so would the entire economy of the planet. Pyrrhon is a scientist, as mentioned. She and her friend, Reever, specifically had an interest in human experimentation. One of my many interests is human cloning! You might be able to see where this is going. All clones and nuclear experiments are done on small asteroid planets. One particularly noted is called FUTURE, where a lot of clones are produced. you might see the name \u201cGamma\u201d mentioned\u2014 she is a clone from here! In OZ, there\u2019s sub-categories. One of these sub categories is the NATIONAL GUARDIAN team. A national guardian is basically the only good job you can get without nepotism. On the outside, you fight. Defend the country. Become police, etc. that\u2019s it. Then you join the National guardian team. \u2014\u2014 It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Marian signs away to the National Guardian\u2014 a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him. He is placed in a group with a grumpy old man as his leader, and another boy, named Khan. Khan has joined hte national guardian team to garner funds for his sister, who has unfortunately died before this point but now he can\u2019t really leave. It\u2019s here that they\u2019re given a CORE A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There\u2019s a rumor that Pyrrhon was the one who killed God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it? A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action. Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN\u2019s whole lifetime can\u2019t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful. You level up your CORE using other\u2019s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth. You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE\u2019s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it. The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist. Now, in order to clone, you need eggs to produce them in. A girl named Chou is a donor, and has been for the past year or so. She\u2019s developed a platonic relationship with Khan, so he lives on for her. Anyway Anyway I forgot most of what happens in the prequel story, but blah blah blah immortality blah blah blah, Khan and Marian are homoerotic enemies blah blah blah Chou joins their team,here\u2019s where things get really bad. Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Whether it be his hard head and big muscles or his strange moral compass, she loves him. And she can do whatever she wants with him. \u201cIt doesn't have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon, \u201cIt just has to be you .\u201d \u2026. On November 12, 2XXX, a child is born. That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. He goes on his last mission with Khan and Chou, putting down a rebellion against Oz by a small group called The Last Hope, and Marian is so DONE. He gazes into Nea\u2019s eyes, He realizes that he really does love Nea. Marian refuses to fight from this point on. He gives his magically-infused scarf to Khan, a soft kiss, and then runs into the night. Khan can only stare in awe. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201dI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. (first dra Pre-Established Basically, Khan and Marian were lumped in with this grumpy ass old man. I think Pyrrhon saw their backgrounds (Khan joined to get funds for his little sister, who was ill) and Marian ran away from his religious training and said \u201cfuck you brah\u201d so she put them with the worst possible guy. So this grumpy old man worked their asses off, to try to get into this huge competition in an arena, so that they\u2019d become National guardians. So they train and train and hate each other and love each other a little, and they end up winning that competition and make it into the national guardian association. Khan becomes kind of an egotistical BITCH at this time and leaves Marian who kind of set him up for the final blow which had them win. Marian sulks around, and he wanders back to his old hut with his master, and oh my god he\u2019s fuckign dead :sob: He doesn\u2019t even tell Khan, he just buries his master by himself. While in the forest, he meets this tiny little girl named Chou. She\u2019s bright blue (like gamma) and missing one eye. She\u2019s relaly, really scared like trembling shaking crying .. he feels pity for her and takes her to the infirmary. She actually thinks that Marian is Khan for some reason, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Anyway, it turns out that Khan\u2019s sister actually fucking died a long time ago, so he took Chou under his wing to take care of. But since he\u2019s been too busy doing whatever shit he does, she\u2019s been lonely. Marian like an idiot, leaves her, and brawls with Marian for like, three hours. He does actually apologize and realize his wrongs, goes to Chou, and they both \u201cadopt\u201d her, basically. Chou is part of the genetic testing batch and was chosen to be a gene donor to some of the clones, so she\u2019s whisked away. They both stop by a bar and kinda go over what\u2019s happened to them so far. How far they\u2019ve come. How they\u2019re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. Actually, before this time, Marian and Pyrrhon had their, uhm! Their run in. So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. Anyway, they end up putting TLH to rest here, and Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019d say. But it can happen! I promise you.\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian joins a small temple in the middle of nowhere. Climbs up the ranks. brings Nea, who;d been born, with him. And Pyrrhon.. OLD DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. After Nea escapes from Future, she has a run in with some guy and Point helps her get a CORE outta one of the PiBots. So, she does that. Gamma comes along and screams, outta my way! She takes that CORE. Point tells Nea to get out. if you get out, you can\u2019t because Gamma challenges you and is like \u201cIzzat point? Goddamn! He really won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d \u201cFive second rule, yk? Gotta get it fresh.\u201d She jams your transmissions and then you fight. The same thing happens if you walk towards her, just with different intro dialogue. *YOU CAN ONLY DEFEAT GAMMA USING A BLOCKBUSTER, or whatever the equal is. It\u2019s because she\u2019s metal and she\u2019s weak to Magic. Dream magic and reg Magic should be a thing. Nea uses Dream Magic She gives up after the first hit from the blockbuxaster and then Gamma just leaves because her pride is hurt. She throws you the CORE and hops away. Okay so you leave into the forest and then uh oh, it\u2019s Gamma. She staggers towards you and begs for a truce. She even gives you her powerbank, which she\u2019s using to power her PiCORE, since she has no external energy to grab. You guys can talk. You can ask her how she knows Point, or who she is. She dances around answering about Point, but they were in the resistance before together :) they tried getting together, and actually kissed! But Gamma is a lesbian (point is gay too) so they don\u2019t really like each other, but they\u2019re just too embarrassed. They kissed before the resistance force shelter was bombed. OH OH SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT where you\u2019re from! \u201cThe over world..? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d She gets all sentimental on you. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like? I hear it\u2019s being overrun by politicians right now\u2026 Oh, really? There\u2019s really no safe space on Earth anymore, huh?\u201d \u201cYou need to talk to Point? .. Oh.\u201d She gives you her powerbank (like just shoves it in her hands), stating that she doesn\u2019t need it anymore. She needs it to fight, but she says that it\u2019s getting harder to fight. It\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m so tired.. Gamma suddenly collapses. A small hologram states that she\u2019s very low on power. Nea just tucks Gamma into the bed next to her. The powerbank and her transmitter are on the side, she hasn\u2019t used it yet. She kinda thKhans about it, before drifting off to sleep\u2026 HOLY FUCK ITS PRODIGAL Prodigal comes along and fucking BURNS the forest down. Nea slams the powerbank back into Gamma, who gets up. She\u2019s stuck in her PiBot mode since Nea is bad with computers. Gamma scares Prodigal off, and then there\u2019s a shot of her amidst the fire, and looking back, like the eclair cyborg picture I had. She extends a hand, and they fly off. You can either get Nea\u2019s route maybe or you can get Tsao and Khan maybe.. Pre-DEMOlition Bijyun opening: A few glitches in the opener when you log in and when you immediately leave afterward. Gamestyle: A short hack-n-slash tutorial. Quick-paced and gets you over the basics, which include: Grappling hooks Basic movement controls Extremely basic fighting controls + crouch/crouch attacks Not too long for the tut sequence, but a little longer for the fighting sequence. \u201cWhew! You okay there, Gamma? Back on track, \u2018Kay? Get going!\u201d Afterward, you get a semi-glitched cutscene, and Gamma falls to the ground. Guess what happened here? Pyrrhon glitched Gamma\u2019s memories! All glitching is actually the memories she had with Prodigal She lands in Marian\u2019s abandoned temple with her motorcycle, the Comet. Cut to Gamma at her new job. \u201c\u2026 And now I\u2019m here. Working under the same person, same conditions, just somewhere else.\u201d A testing sequence, 1v1 battle against a harder foe + a few troop waves. As she tosses it up into the air (carelessly), it\u2019s shot out of her hands and Prodigal fucking eats it. Anim.cut where Gamma loses her job. She\u2019s pretty unreliable anyway. \u201cBut I\u2014!\u201d \u201cOn , you failed to retrieve \u2019s heart\u201d On ___ you took Lock\u2019s left lung for your own personal gain\u201d Etc. it\u2019s actually extremely funny how unreliable she is. They throw her over the side of the fucking building because she gets into a fight She lands, hard. She\u2019s gasping for air, but somehow still clinging onto the life she once had. \u2026 and then Nea falls next to her. She isn\u2019t in as much pain as Gamma, but that throw was supposed to kill, so thank God for Gamma being there to break her fall. \u201c\u2026 Got fired too?\u201d Says Gamma. Nea gasps for air. \u201c\u2026 yeah.\u201d They just kind of, sit there. It\u2019s raining, they\u2019re basically going to die. There\u2019s nowhere to go. They\u2019re both bleeding out into each other. That\u2019s what Nea says, at least. Gamma tries to keep them both awake, but they both end up collapsing from blood loss. Potential Shenx meeting instead of Huangzhi, who takes them both and says \u201chey Prodigal is being really mean to us and we need you guys to take her out.\u201d Gamma was an experiment to make a clone as \u2018human\u2019 as possible. Prodigal was the second part to make the clone as robotic as possible. With this, they studied how they fared in battle situations. Prodigal was genuinely fucking FASCINATED with Gamma, like obsessively, and stalked her around. Gamma really hated Prodigal for that. Actually, Gamma was barely aware of Prodi\u2019s existence. Pyrrhon did everything in her power to keep them separated. This is where the \u201cProdigal Boss\u201d Lore comes into play. She finds Gamma with Nea, who she sort of just observes from a distance. Think Hornet, from Hollow Knight, or Road, from D. Gray-Man. Yes, she causes all sorts of issues, but they never come face to face. But tensions build. At the end of a chase scene, Nea stabs down Prodigal. Prodigal doesn\u2019t even fight, and only falls limply to the ground.

Post Demolition Introduce Prodial!~ REWRITING HEAVILY DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. Meanwhile, with Gamma.. Running through the forest. She ate a mysterious fruit (tomato) earlier, and is beginning to choke. She\u2019s not allergic\u2014 did you know thai8t Clones have extremely strict dietary restrictions? Ref to the acid reflux. Someone (who is a little easily seen from the background) hops out and basically like, fucking guts her. I\u2019m kidding. What she does is open the latch on her stomach which pours out some of the stomach acid. Gamma shakily gets up. \u201c\u2026 wh-who..?!\u201d \u201cYer lucky you\u2019re a gen 3 clone. Any higher an\u2019 ya would\u2019ve died already.\u201d Gamma\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re a c\u2014!!\u201d \u201cSame batch as you. Humanities, Div 3. Pleased to meetcha.\u201d Honey shakes her hand. \u201cYou can call me Honey. \u2018S what my friend calls me. Any other name an\u2019 I gut ya you for parts, \u2018Kay?\u201d \u201c\u2026 Gamma.\u201d \u201cA pleasure. Where ya headed?\u201d \u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The story so far is explained with a fade to black. Honey puts her hands behind her back. \u201cYou wanna find \u2018em?\u201d Gamma nods. \u201cSaw sum suspicious figures while I was fishin\u2019. Old fart and bratty monk.\u201d \u201cMonk?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got the marking\u2019s of one. Star an\u2019 refined magic an everything. \u201c\u2026 Huh.\u201d \u201cProlly resigned if she\u2019s talkin with you. | Ah, look at that. We\u2019re here.\u201d (Opening to the new island, the one where Honey and Constantine are. The one that\u2019s a Baguio/Bontoc replica). \u201cBut-but\u2014!\u201d \u201cShh. Yer injured. I\u2019ve adopted you. I\u2019m obligated to.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat, wanna go fight?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just leave them!\u201d Honey kind of stares at her for a second, and then punches her. She flies across the map and ragdoll collides with the window barriers. Very loose physics. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even beat me, how do you expect to save your friends?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cSee? Okay. I get a discount, since my girlfriend works there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Khan and Nea are tied up and about to be thrown into the incinerator. Khan says something about her father, and then\u2014! \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me and not her,\u201d says Nea. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t see me like this,\u201d says Khan, to Marian (depending on who you\u2019re playing as). Honey and Gamma show up, and you do an equally fun aoe damage dungeon with them instead. Khan and Honey give each other glares at the end but Nea and Gamma are happy to see each other again. \u201cSo, now what?\u201d Gamma and Nea sit at the edge of the cliff and point towards Pyrrhon\u2019s empire in the distant summer sunset. \u201cThere.\u201d Cool perspective shot of all of them, then the chapter ends. One Shots and Whatnot Species Chibao (Khan, Clementine, and Rhaikha-Lei). ChiBao\u2019s live for a very long time, they\u2019re like the elf equivalent in CORE. It is a male dominated culture, with women being very rare and held at utmost care. When you think of magic capabilities, these are the ones you think of. These are the pioneers of magic creation, even the controversial refined magic. From the start to the end, magic has run through the veins of the ChiBao. Stats They tend to lean towards speed and offense with low Defense and HP. This is because they don\u2019t usually get hit in general and use ranged attacks most often. This can vary between personalities. Physical Appearances Easily defined by their slender figures and pure white eyes, the ChiBao originated as a small tribe around Southeast Asia. They wear makeup made of ashes around their eyes. On occasion, they will wear the ashes of their enemies when going into war. Traditional clothing includes long, flowing hair (typically braids) and long scarves or other forms of clothing. This symbolizes their long lives. Due to their environment, their colors are usually warm/brownish colors. Their hands are absurdly large and calloused. They don\u2019t shave off their callouses, since it serves as a natural protection against their strong magic. History The ChiBao are credited for the first recordings of asexual reproduction that wasn\u2019t cloning. This was later tabooed. Their cells are completely incompatible with other species, so they can\u2019t have other mixes of children. They eat the other ones up like acid. Consequently, there are very little ChiBao in existence today, so they\u2019re held in generally high regard. They are a very \u2018purist\u2019 tribe, since they are physically incapable of mixing with other species. Their religion, however, is open to any species, gender, and color. Chiru (Nea, Chasmus, Marian, and Shenx). More magic-oriented than Inozha, but much less than the ChiBao. The \u2018unicorns\u2019 of CORE. They are so widespread, that there is no one tradition that the Chiru adapt. They instead adapt of wherever they are staying in. The most average of all the species. Stats It varies between personality, but they tend to lean more towards offense OR defense. There is not one or the other. They tend to use short-ranged attacks due to their size. Physical appearance It\u2019s very common for them to be short and stubby legged, but a few have had absurd growth spurts which boost them to normal height. Since their legs are abnormal, they are prone to injury. Many people have surgery or \u2018splints\u2019 inserted into their legs, like Huangzhi. Nea simply doesn\u2019t run very often for this fact. They have a lot of color variation, but go more towards cool, dark colors. Chiru are known for having the fastest hair growth out of anyone else. History They originally began as a small nomad tribe who picked up various other wanderers of other cultures and species. Because of this.. cesspool, they eventually grew strong together and took over large parts of the Earth. they are so widespread that there is no stereotype that could fit any of them. Inozha (Constantine, Shou, Pyrrhon, Han, Hal, Clementine, and Coda) The secondary average tribe, but with no magic. Absolutely none. The \u2018red blooded Americans\u2019. Also extremely widespread, but stereotyped to be big, burly, and aggressive. The \u201cearth ponies\u201d. stats Extreme offense! It\u2019s very, very rare for them ever to rely on anything else! Brute force, amiriight?! Physical Appearance Extreme color variety, from skin color to colors. These are the species that popularized clothing. Very fashionable and adaptable. They have small bodies but are extremely quick and powerful. history They came in very late to the whole Stickfigure sub species scene, and when they did, they brought up the Industrial Revolution. They brought clothes, colonization, money, technology, etc to both magic oriented tribes. Because of their alliance with the Chiru, Chiru lost touch of their extreme magic capabilities over time. The Inozha are heavily credited towards .. capitalism and business. Nai (Honey, Gamma, Kei, Kai, Prodigal, Python, Huangzhi, and Chou). A simple term used to describe those who don\u2019t fall into any of those categories. Everyone in here is mostly a clone.","title":"SPACE MONKEY"},{"location":"Bits/Story/SPACE%20MONKEY/#i-want","text":"There\u2019s this gang of animal-like people. They\u2019re actually trying to revive a dead religion and all believe that they are one with the spirits of their warrior ancestors. They are not. Gamma and Nea seek freedom To disrupt Pyrrhon\u2019s control, which seems impossible. MAYBE go back to the video game plot; the one where Pyrrhon is self aware They will do this by constructing the ULTIMATE CORE! Using theft Trading/bartering At first: nea is fired whatergver Brawl with Gamma \u201cFuck you!\u201d \u201cFuck you!\u201d Get lost in forest. \u201cOh it\u2019s you\u201d. Gamma and Nea meet from a peace treaty. Instead of Prodigal, they are initially followed by Commander Vee. He wants to kill both of them simply to raise his hierarchal status. \u201cWhat luck, that I\u2019d find two beautiful girls, all trapped in here like this! Come now!\u201d Nea: this guy got me fired! Gamma: this guy got me fired! They run away and he\u2019s really mad so he chases them around. Now: Run around to get information and more gear Ok so they hide under the bar tables when Vee shows up to the slaughterhouse. They see how he threatens Shenx and brags about how he can leave this useless slum anytime he wants, and he has a home up there in the heavens. It\u2019s fact checked by Gamma\u2014 he does! They now want to kill him to get that. However they have no fuckin idea where he is. This guy\u2019s all bark no bite.. if we can get ahold of his stuff, we\u2019d be rich beyond belief! We gotta kill this guy! \u201cYou might wanna talk to your brother, Gamma.\u201d \u201cH-huh?! How\u2019d you\u2014?!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve (shnx and const) been friends for decades. \u2018Course I know who you are.\u201d Nea: (Maybe this girl is useful. Hah). Constantine is over in (Baguio!) Cue them being productive and encountering a few sidequests: Eskalion\u2019s attack patterns ATK one: Starts from one side of the stage, and runs at you at blinding speeds. It\u2019ll damage you if you\u2019re in the middle of it. He teleports and reappears above you and does one of two things A) he will shoot DIRECTLY BELOW HIM B) he will shoot to both corners of the room. Then he will disappear and reappear either grabbing at the walls or on the ground, preparing to fight again. If he\u2019s on the wall, he will shoot in your general direction four times, teleport behind you, (he will linger so you can counter or move away), and swing. The swing is really big, but so is his cooldown. If he\u2019s on the ground, he can: shoot at you with his gun jump up (From jumping up, he can either guard and reflect all bullets back at the player, OR he can throw a bomb. It basically goes in a straight line and can go as far as like, 25% of the room. So from the starting point (when he throws it) and when it ends, it bounces three times. Then, it\u2019ll explode into large pillars which reach to the top of the room). lunge again At 25% health, he\u2019ll crawl up to the top of the room, and swing around on a chandelier. He will shoot at you hysterically and you can\u2019t deal any damage, so you just have to avoid it or guard. After that, he\u2019s in a ravenous state and has increased speed, but lowered defense. His atk is much much higher thoughSo after this you probably get an introduction to Constantine and CORE buffs. End Once he dies, I\u2019ll initiate Prodigal/Balach\u2019s arc, HORRAY! So upon death, he crawls over to the wall, while Gamma puts a gun in his head. He starts rambling incoherently about \u201cGod\u2019s divine Will\u201d, \u201crevenge\u201d, \u201cthe Goddess\u201d, and other nonsensical religious bullshit. He then lets out a final plea of himself being a prophet or whatever, general religious psychosis talk. Then, he reaches out to the wall, and presses a big red button (which was once enclosed in a glass container). After that, the windows all shatter, and Prodigal jumps in. Vee starts talking to her and asks if she\u2019s proud of him, but she just shoots him. Gamma and Nea are frozen in fear. Prodigal ignores them, and throws his limp body across the room, like a child playing with a toy. She then rips his head off and plays with his entrails. Yay! The screen blacks out and Prodigal is gone, Gamma and Nea both passed out. All that\u2019s left is black goop and Vee\u2019s gun, which you can take and use. Now, Gamma and Nea were trying to kill Vee so that they could get his ID shard, fake his identity, and rob him and the other corpos + get into restricted areas. However Prodigal broke it. Lmfao. Anyway the cops start to show up, so a cutscene plays where they just run out of the building.That\u2019s the end of the chapter. So there\u2019s a huge explosion and Gamma and Nea are blown away. They both wake up seeing Honey, but they dont know who she is. She drops them on the ground, flicks over a business card, then leaves. Cut to the Baguio place festival. Gamma is looking. ok basically if you go to Prodigal, you go to the Akira collesum It\u2019s basically dogtown. \u201cRumor has it, it\u2019s completely outta Pyrrhon\u2019s control. Being in No Man\u2019s Land, an\u2019 everything\u2026 bet ya haven\u2019t heard of it, huh? Let me show ya \u2018round.\u201d \u201dexcuse you! Everyone knows about this place.\u201d \u201cYeah.. I\u2019ve only heard rumors.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s.. oddly quiet.\u201d \u201dYeah, no merchants jumping out, huh? Hah. Guess if yer here, you\u2019re here coz ya know what you want. They don\u2019t need to sell you nothin\u2019. They got corpos an\u2019 war criminals, all in one place.\u201d \u201dHuh..\u201d \u201dHeard you could get up to the space station if you had enough money.. well, you can get anything if you have enough money.\u201d (Cue guy selling organs) \u201d\u2026 uh huh. So, who are we lookin\u2019 for, again?\u201d (Point). PREDEM II FINAL DUNGEON The lives we\u2019ve left behind And whatever God is left for us. \u201cThe factory\u2019s been abandoned for some time now. But it started pumping out materials again!\u201d \u201cHuh? What is the factory? Well, it was from the RAPTURE, it\u2019s got some of Pyrrhon\u2019s old radiators. If someone tries hard enough, they could make a bomb, but\u2014..\u201d \u201cH-hey!! Where are you two rascals going?!\u201d \u201cThis is it,\u201d Says Nea. \u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d Says Gamma. Get in the side scroller mode for a period of time and hijack a ship entering from the factory. Fight through it with the terrain changing due to the changes in altitude. You play as Gamma first when they agree to split up. You go through a large wave of enemies and hit the button to stop the power flow, but the ship still goes. It\u2019s up to Nea. Cutscene of Nea running along the side of the ship and into Balach\u2019s chamber. Follow him through a third wave in the storage cavity. \u201cHAHAHAH\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re pathetic, Nea!\u201d \u201cJust try to find me!\u201d you can\u2019t actually find him. Break through the door and walk through it, and get pinned to the ground by Balach. \u201cHah..!\u201d each line of dialogue takes off like, 10% of your remaining HP. \u201cLook at you! Pathetic!\u201d \u201cYOU took EVERYTHING from me!\u201d \u201cHahhah.. hahah .. look at you,\u201d \u201cWEAK!! YOU\u2019RE WEAK, NEA!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you are. A fuckin mindless puppet of your father.\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE HIDEOUS!\u201d Balach kicks her. Nea\u2019s HP falls to 0. \u201cHah..\u201d \u201cFutile, as always.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my end goal with you.\u201d Balach flicks a switch which turns on a screen on top of every single school, temple, and family. \u201cYou see, Nea?\u201d \u201cHahah. You didn\u2019t even know.\u201d \u201cNow, your CORE\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one powerful enough besides myself.\u201d \u201cHeheh..\u201d \u201cWait here, whore .\u201d Balach leaves. Nea rolls over and regenerates one HP. He walks in and nudges her with his foot. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re still awake?\u201d \u201cI should\u2019ve killed you, all those years ago.\u201d \u201cYou and your father.\u201d \u201cHah.\u201d \u201cRemember that day? You remember it well.\u201d \u201cI did plan on Pyrrhon. What I didn\u2019t plan on was his suicide. And you .\u201d \u201cThat CORE,\u201d He grabs Nea\u2019s chest. \u201cThat CORE is mine .\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cGive it up, Nea. Give it to me.\u201d Nea limply falls, but says one thing: \u201c\u2026 You killed him?\u201d Balach doesn\u2019t listen and takes out a knife. Nea grabs it. \u201cDad..\u201d \u201c...\u201d \u201cMy dad...\u201d Congrats to you and Nea for unlocking her secondary ULT!!~ ULT: BLOOD DRIVE is now active! Nea gathers all the blood seeped into the floor and revives herself with it. Whether enemy or stick, it\u2019s hers now. She fights Balach again, who\u2019s basically a dummy. He goes through the same cycle but you just deal infinitely more damage than he does. You chase after him and break all his shields until you pummel him into the ground, like the real ground, since youre in the sky. The dust settles. He\u2019s nothing but a CORE. Nea looks around. She\u2019s right next to a body of water, and a mysteriously burnt pillar. A nearby old and wet paper drifts in the wind. Versailles.. Nea crushes Balach\u2019s CORE, And falls asleep. Gamma falls to the ground in a nearby parachute, picks Nea up, and walks home. End of act one. From Now on Our primary goals after chapter One is character development and slower plot progression. CHARA GOAL: Focus on Gamma or Nea or Honey or Python Choice, can be done in any order. DRIVING FORCE End goal: stop Pyrrhon. Short term: Grow Stronger get PB CORE\u2019s for story progression. Stars EQ \u201cThere are five total maj chords we need in order to weaken Pyrrhon and nullify her core output. They\u2019re here.\u201d After all that, they get the goal and have one final life-changing event, then leads into the finale. Act 2: The Arena. I had a thought.. Now, CORE has a cool mechanic where you do not kill a single enemy. You knock them out. They will infinitely respawn once you take too long and until you reach the next area. You don\u2019t have to kill them, but you will get more rewards from the more you do. \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 is a rule Nea and Gamma stand by, since they\u2019re mostly fighting clones and Nea is obligated from religion. It goes something like this. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since Balach\u2019s death and Nea\u2019s evolution. She\u2019s still recovering from the magic overload. She\u2019s fine, I guess. Since we\u2019re alone, I\u2019ll tell ya, I\u2019m kinda jealous. I wish I could be as good as her. I wish I was useful. Goddamnit, look at the time! My food\u2019s ready! See ya later!\u201c CTSCNE Honeycakes swings a fish onto the table and begins to skin it. Chasmus takes the chopped pieces from earlier and pours it into a pot. Han takes a finished plate and carries it out. From above, Prodigal and Lane snicker. Prodigal reaches down to take the plate. Han looks around, confused. Chasmus looks angry and Han looks back, sheepishly. Prodigal hands the kebab to Lane, who eats it happily and giggles. They kick their feet off the roof and gaze off into the sky. Camera shifts and fades into the upper left. Khan is sharpening his sword from atop a mountain. Python is starting a nearby fire out of old parts and notices the town. The fireworks explode. Gamma and Nea walk through the town. \u201cHeheh! I told ya!\u201d \u201cWhatever, sure! Heh. Ow!!\u201d \u201cOops, sorry. I had this idea\u2026 Honey and Gamma become friends, almost immediately. It\u2019s quick, like a gust of wind. They talk, inside the restaurant. It\u2019s a dog eat dog world out there, they both know. Gamma says, \u201cDude, if I were rich, I\u2019d go up into the stars.. You know, the interplanetary cities? We can live it up there. Hah! \u2018s impossible though, we\u2019re stuck down here.\u201d Honey, \u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as you think. Networking\u2019s mostly what it comes to.\u201d Honey pulls out a pouch from underneath the couch cushions. I have a CORE so unbelievably powerful, it could stop Pyrrhon in her tracks, easy. The power\u2019s unregulated\u2014 one of her own. You could use this to get to the stars, easy. people would bow to you. You\u2019d be at her level. However This CORE is not yet complete. This CORE is the project of fifteen groups of people, just like you. Hundreds of thousands.. I\u2019ve lost count. There\u2019s too many. My days of fighting are over. I do not seek revenge. But you two\u2026 \u2026 Should you so desire, the next part of the CORE is located in the mountain. It is supplying a group of undead AI who named themselves \u201c The Datura .\u201d \u2026 If you must, I ask you proceed with caution. I don\u2019t want you to end up like everyone else. Gamma takes it at an almost comical speed. Honey laughs sadly. \u201cTo get up the mountain, you must go through hordes of CORES and AI. You have to travel through a forest which not even I have progressed.\u201d Gamma stops her. \u201cThen so be it! We don\u2019t make any difference here anyway!! We either live or live long enough to be killed, and if I even have the chance to make a difference, then why would I give that up?! I\u2019ll be killed, that\u2019s it. Yeah, I know! But, if I can at least\u2026\u201d Nea looks down, ashamed. Honey hesitates. \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a passion much like yours anymore, much less in a clone .\u201d Gamma stands up. \u201cBeing a clone doesn\u2019t mean jackshit! If yer here ta just rail on me for bein\u2019 one, then\u2014!\u201d \u201cTch!\u201d Honey stands up and forces her down. \u201cAll this this and that that yer goin\u2019 on about! Calm down!\u201d Gamma and Nea glance at each other awkwardly. \u201cWhat I mean ,\u201d Honey says. \u201cIs you\u2019ve got a heart. Not a great thing, but not a bad thing, either.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d Honey rubs her temples. \u201cI.. You two..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 are absolutely insufferable!! \u201d Honey groans. \u201cPack up! We\u2019re leaving tomorrow!\u201d Nea stiffens. \u201cWh-what?!\u201d \u201cYou heard me! Hey, Han! Get \u2018em a room! Chasmus, take it outta my check. I got work ta do, go pack up an\u2019 get up!\u201d \u201cw-we already have a\u2014\u201d \u201cLOCK \u2018EM UP!!!\u201d \u2026 So Gamma and Nea sleep for the night, and are awoken at 3 AM by Honeycakes. \u201cc\u2019mon! this is baby work!\u201d Honey swings her hammer over her shoulder. \u201cY\u2019all are pathetic! Overthrowing a world leader and ya can\u2019t even get up? C\u2019mon!\u201d \u2026 And they go to the mountain. CTSNE of Honey breaking down the rusty gates leading up. Gamma laughs. \u201cDamn! we\u2019ve got nothin ta worry about, huh?\u201d She puts her arms behind her head. \u201cWith that , you can even rival Omega!\u201d \u201c\u2026 The one who beat up Pyrrhon?\u201d Gamma nods. Nea perks up. \u201cY-yeah! they were the same color as you, Gamma!\u201d \u201cGen 3 clone!\u201d Gamma puffs up her chest. \u201cWe\u2019re the last sentient clones around coz of him! Hah!\u201d Honey scratches the back of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something to brag about.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d Gamma says, \u201cWhat Division were you? I was 12.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Honey says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to bash in skulls, not talk about your tragic backstory! Hurry up!!\u201d Stage 1 \u2014 Honey You play as Gamma and Nea for a bit until you get to a puzzle that only Honey can do. she chastises them and plows through it for them. You get to play as just her for the rest of the level, which isn\u2019t very much. Should be medium difficulty of more puzzles and exploration with minimal fighting until the end. Precision platforming Stage 2 \u2014 The Datura Small fighting sequence with the Datura AI. Gamma complains that they\u2019re stronger than usual and Honey snaps that it\u2019s the CORE. If it\u2019s the CORE you wanna get, it\u2019s the CORE you must defeat! This stage is more of a fighting stage than the last. After the first wave, you explore a small maze to heal, then fight a secondary wave. Stage 3 \u2014 Rattlesnake in the flowers Woah, the CORE is right there, unguarded! No, no it\u2019s not. Python\u2019s guarding it. Nea screams, exasperated. \u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?\u201d Honeycakes grips her hammer. \u201cWe\u2019re going after her!\u201d The walls suddenly begin to close in (they\u2019re indoors) and it\u2019s a speed precision race to the end of the level. If you do a secret level you can get Gamma\u2019s motorcycle Stage 4 \u2014 Python RUH roh it\u2019s the Datura again!!! You bash in a round until you encounter Python. Insert conversation Python boss fight obtain bit of CORE! \u201cIs that it?\u201d Asks Gamma. Honey shakes her head. \u201cNope. That bitch ass cut it up. Looks like the Datura got some. Let\u2019s kill em!\u201d Stage 5 \u2014 Venom Python again :skull: Gamma says, \u201cLeave us alone! We don\u2019t want nothing with you!\u201d Python Points towards Honey: \u201cIt\u2019s not you two I want.\u201d Honey/Python conflict G: H-hold on! Honey can\u2019t\u2014.. That .. Omega\u2019s a clone! Honey-Honey.. she\u2019s\u2014 P: and how do you think she obtained such a high power weapon? She hasn\u2019t worked with the temples to obtain magic, right, Nea? N: \u2026 P: And Gamma, your fists, they\u2019re magic, aren\u2019t they? G: but\u2026 P: And what does that make you, Honeycakes? Non-religious magic possessor? H: \u2026 H: \u2026 H: \u2026 It\u2019s been a while, Python. G: Honey\u2014?! (Honey swings out her hammer) P: Ah? I save your life, and this is the thanks I get?! H: Tch! P: A murderer, that\u2019s what you always were! Just take out my CORE like you never even knew me in the first place! I dare you! P: and you.. you\u2019ve got a following, don\u2019t you now? P: Hah.. hahah\u2026 you\u2019re probably lying to them, too huh?! P: PATHETIC!! P: Come on, Honey! P: Life\u2019s just a game, right?! Isn\u2019t that what you told me?! P: SO WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH FIGHTING TIL MY DEATH?!?! Battle start Something something. Fight her. Something else. Fight the Datura This is possibly the hardest fight here then. Well after that fiasco (survive long enough, lol. You can\u2019t defeat every single enemy, it\u2019s an endless wave until the timer runs out) and an unskippable death plays out. They are separated by Khan , with the last piece of the CORE, who comes to fully activate it. The blow upon activation is so insanely powerful that: Honey and Gamma are blown away Nea and Python are blown away. Chasmus is left alone. Stage 6 \u2014 Memory Cards Nea, Lane, Const, and Prodigal. Gamma and Nea wake up in a dingy alleyway in a common city. As they start to walk around, Nea gets a splitting headache and falls tot he ground. G: \u201cN\u2014.. Nea?! Are you okay?!\u201d N: \u201cGh .. damn\u2014.. damn fuckin\u2019 w.. ah..\u201d G: \u201c Oh.. Right, CORE density is much higher here.\u201d G: \u201cD-don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll get you somewhere safe!!\u201d N: \u201cI-.. I\u2019m sorry..\u201d Gamma hefts Nea on her back Oh shit it\u2019s Lane and Prodigal!! Prodigal kidnaps gamma, and leaves Nea on the ground. Cue quickly moving stage with hard obstacles. After the stage, small cutscene of Nea spying on Prodigal and her group (Lock, Lane, and Conte) and dragging Gamma away like a spider in a web. Nea tries to sneak out, but is caught by Conte and Lock who do a combo attack and kick her out. Cue Constantine They catch her as she falls. They\u2019d gone to D4 for business, but for some reason caught a nerualink of Gamma and decided to come over. Constantine is here to deliver a USB of blackmail to someone in the underworld. \u201cWell, what are you guys wanting for?!\u201d Nea points towards the giant building Prodigal ran off to. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Gamma!\u201d This dungeon.. is incredibly long! 4 waves of enemies, and 2 waves of puzzle. The first puzzle wave is just for entering the building, the other one is for getting to the 4th wave and then Prodigal. 2nd wave is more complicated. Each wave includes a different challenge (ie consistent bleed, projectiles, immobilized, more projectiles but it\u2019s bigger). At the end, they get into a glass elevator and go up to the sky. You can vaguely see the conflict with Khan, Python, and Honey, but they pay it no mind. When you finish, cut to Gamma. You walk out of your cage, and into an eerily quiet hallway. You find yourself back in Future, trying to escape. It\u2019s actually almost impossible to lose here; you have almost infinite health and deal insane damage. Upon reaching the end, you fall down onto Earth, look up, and\u2014! Oh, it\u2019s just Prodigal. You\u2019re tied up against a wall and she\u2019s staring at you intently. A bad robotic voice asks, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d Prodigal slams her fist the wall beside Gamma. \u201cDo you remember? What we did?\u201d \u201cAll those years..\u201d \u201cDo you remember Who helped you escape from Future?\u201d Do you remember anything? Nea and Constantine break in from the ceiling and throw Lock and Conte off the sides. Prodigal tries to escape through the ceiling, but Honey throws her down. Constantine gets Gamma off of the wall and Shenx looks around. And shit goes down. It basically escalates to puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal \u2192 puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal again, with Gamma 4life required. During the first puzzle, Lane says, \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her!!\u201d And once she is defeated, Prodigal takes her and runs away. During the second puzzle, Lane tries again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take her away from me!!\u201d But she ends up falling to the ground. Prodigal asks one more time. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d Gamma slides back and spits blood onto the ground \u201cHell no!\u201d Prodigal jams her against the wall and presses her thumb into Gamma\u2019s forehead When Gamma fell in future, she saw Pyrrhon, who held a gun. She also saw Prodigal. She remembers prodigal. Flashbacks of how Prodigal helped her before, helped her fight, Pyrrhon says, \u201cnight night~\u201d And the video glitches to black. Prodigal asks. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d The conversation Gamma: \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Gamma: \u201cAre you pleased with yourself?\u201d Gamma: \u201cDo you enjoy killing everybody in sight? Do you get some sorta sick high off of seeing people scream and cry and\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d .. You win.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing I lost.. Everything..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. What\u2019s left of me?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing that she\u2014\u201c Prodigal: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cThe consequences are far too great for me to return home empty handed.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease allow me to have this one thing. The only freedom I\u2019ll ever get.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI lost.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win, okay?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d [Gamma\u2019s hands fall to her side]. Prodigal: \u201c.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you can\u2019t- can\u2019t ever forgive me, but..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI have to thank you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI found you.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy sole reason for existence.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTo find you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma, you..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAs much as you hated me, I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t stand how they treated you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou remember, right? The cloning facility.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cA clone of my being..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d And yet, human despite it all.\u201d Prodigal: \u201d I couldn\u2019t let them take that away from you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cHahah. You ran away from me, didn\u2019t you? I was the reason you\u2019re here now with your scars and burnt edges.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you hated me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just\u2014..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c(shiver, cough)\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just really..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I can spend my last moments with you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy little sister..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cOhh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cH-hey\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPut my metal carcass of a soul to good use, okay?\u201d Gamma: \u201cPuh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProdigal, you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease just\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201cProdigal, are you\u2014!?\u201d [Prodigal flops down on the floor]. Prodigal: \u201c.. Please.\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhat are you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cShe took you away from me, and I\u2014\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. Your pitiful expression, that day..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt was too much for me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong for God to save me now.\u201d [Gamma grabs Prodigal\u2019s hand] Gamma: \u201cProdigal just\u2014!..\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhy\u2014.. Why couldn\u2019t you have\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201cYOU IDIOT!\u201d [Gamma slams the ground] Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!\u201d Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDNT YOU\u2014?!\u201d (Gamma wipes away tears) Gamma: \u201cI.. I could\u2019ve saved you, Prodigal..! I-I thought that\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI never hated you.\u201d Gamma: \u201cI know. I know but why\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201c.. Why coulnd\u2019t you have told me?\u201d Gamma: \u201cSo that I\u2014.\u201d Gamma: \u201c.. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cLook at you now.\u201d [Prodigal lifts a shaking hand onto Gamma\u2019s chest or hand] Prodigal: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d [Prodigal laughs quietly] Prodigal: \u201cOh, Gamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIf only I\u2014..\u201d Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. can spend my last moments..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cwith you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy baby sister..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProd-.. PRODIGAL?!\u201d Prodigal fucking SHOOTS herself Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL! WAKE UP! PRODIGAL! PRODIGAL!\u201d [Gamma shakes Prodigal frantically, but her core flies out]. Prodigal faded away into the night, melting away with the distant summer sun. The only fading memory of Prodigal, her CORE, the very bane of her existence, rests in Gamma\u2019s bloodied hands. \u2026 Gamma equips Prodigal\u2019s CORE. \u2026 \u2026 Lane shows up beside Gamma, and stares at Prodigal\u2019s empty carcass. A slash, and Lane is also nothing but a desecrated corpse. \u2026 \u2026 Nea reconvenes with Gamma, who is still, and can\u2019t move. She hugs Gamma, who passes out upon touch. \u2026 \u2026 Honey\u2019s CORE is one half fuller. Prodigal had the third piece. \u2026 \u2026 Act 3: The Hive Crossing Over the Line Refresh your memory, or when you wanna be, the Phantom\u2019s on the way, She\u2019s coming down the street. Summer lights, seems to me, I\u2019m in a dream. This summer night\u2026 Huangzhi Khan, Python, Honey, Kai, and The Avatar . Back at the Slaughterhouse, Gamma\u2019s finally woken back up. She doesn\u2019t seem to feel like talking, but says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d anyway. the CORE\u2019s one half fuller. two more chunks to go. One is with Python, the other with someone else however, the conflict with Prodigal brought Honey\u2019s CORE to the attention of Pyrrhon, who set off after them. As they leave The Slaughterhouse, Gamma, Nea, and Honey are tracked down by police and chased. if you get caught it\u2019s a game over\u2014 you have to run to the next town over before they give up. This town is similar to a beehive. They throw a man to the ground as they go and he is shot down by police. Due to Honey\u2019s mass amount of strength, she is mistaken for a temple leader and is whisked away. Gamma and Nea are left alone. Follow Honey, she tries to fight but is put down by what looks like DGM CROW\u2019s talismans. Turns out the guy that they killed at the entrance was a high level temple leader\u2026 Nea has a panic attack as she realizes he died (shot by police). They currently mistake Honey to be that man. He didn\u2019t have a determinable gender so they just say she\u2019s a girl. she makes up a bullshit response which is obviously fake but fucking works anyway. You learn a small bit of her past through a flashback. Gamma and Nea sneak into her room via the window at the top of her ceiling. She\u2019s happy! At this time, you can now do side quests in this town. it\u2019s recommended you do at least one so you can unlock the inns and shops in this town. When they go outside, Honey sees Python. She summons her hammer ready to strike\u2014 She holds a small girl by her ponytail, and plugs the CORE into her. ??? \u201c\u2026 P\u2014.. Python..?\u201d P \u201cShh.. shh, you\u2019re still weak. Are you okay?\u201d ??? \u201cMy-my master, he\u2014..\u201d P \u201cshh.. it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay.\u201d ??? \u201cP-Python, I\u2014.. I\u2019m so sorry, y-you..\u201d P \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. It wasn\u2019t that hard, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Python puts her injured arm behind her back and continues to stroke the girl\u2019s head. \u2026 \u2026 You can choose to still attack Python or not Attacked The bad ending. You strike, and Python flinches. You have struck the girl and killed her. Python stares at the girl in tears. H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201dYou-..\u201d H \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Honey.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d a DDLC esque glitch sequence sends Honey back to her room. Knock Knock Knock, Honey\u2019s woken up by guns. Gamma and Nea are nowhere to be found. She prioritizes herself and runs out of a really fucking dangerous dungeon outside of the town. She slips and falls suddenly, and someone puts their feet on her back. Huangzhi says, \u201cI got her. Take her in.\u201d The police show up, lead by Python. the CORE is implemented into her , embedded in to her back. \u201c\u2026 Police, dismiss. I will handle her.\u201d they disperse. \u201dThis is our fight, Honey.\u201d \u201dWill you fight me, or die like a dog?\u201d The hardest boss fight in the game starts here, lol. it\u2019s kind of impossible to win and it generally just encourages you to go show mercy to Python, the longer route. If you manage to beat her with just Honey on two lives, you wrench the CORE out of her back and kill her. Python is dead, but the CORE is 25% fuller. you return to the town like nothing happened. Mercy The good ending. You just get up and leave. Nearby guards ask Honey if she saw an intruder, but she declines. P. \u201c\u2026\u201d H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P. \u201cThanks.\u201d Python leaves with the girl. She leaves behind a really good weapon upgrader. Alright, so! You return back to your room. You might want to add more stuff in here. So you go into the hallway: Khan, and a few other people are there. While you try to refuse walking into the room, they refuse you.. haha. They talk to Honey and vaguely hint that they know who she is. When her fingers inch towards her Kendama, they tie her up immidletly and throw her at the bottom of an arena. Huangzhi sits there with Khan, twirling a key. \u201cGo.\u201d All of the NPCs from the town or temple attack you. When you get closer\u2026 Khan takes the CORE off of the pedestal, and then inserts it into a little boy. He attacks Honey. After winning (or, \u2018winning\u2019), Honey is thrown back and almost gets hit, until the attack is blocked\u2026 \u201cJust like old times, huh?\u201d It\u2019s Python! Similarly to the Ummu fight, she assists you. After the fight, there\u2019s a looong scene of an explosion. You seem to have won, the temple is in shambles, and no one can be seen. And then a missile is shot into Python\u2019s back. You have two seconds to press \u201cx\u201d to grab. if you don\u2019t, then the (INSERT GANG HERE) will attack you. if you do, they will stop and provide healing every now and then. That\u2019s the only difference it has. You catch a mild glimpse of PYRRHON. She saw you. She knows Honey runs with Python through the forest while being chased by Pyrrhon, who runs at lightspeed. Honey is thrown off of a cliff\u2014 She starts to fall, is this how it ends? I never even got to meet my mother, I never even got to.. I worked so hard.. is this the life I get? her hands are grabbed by Python, who\u2019s leaning off of a boat controlled by Gamma and Nea. She\u2019s hoisted onto the boat and runs off. As they hop back on land, the boat crashes but no one pays it any mind. A gang of bandits suddenly come out with knives. Gamma and Nea step forward to protect Honey. \u201cStand down\u201d, says Python. \u201cIt\u2019s solved.\u201d There\u2019s a group of groans and they all walk away. \u201cYou were going to AMBUSH me?!\u201d \u201cI DIDN\u2019T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO REACT!!\u2019 \u201cREACT TO WHAT?!?!?!?\u201d Gamma and Nea look at each other and sigh. Camera pan. Python sits atop the cliff, and gestures Khan away. Huangzhi later comes over, but he is thrown into the ocean. End of act 3. End of act three. Act 4: Late Loves Lamentations The world\u2019s on fire. After the HIVE, Nea and Gamma go to a nearby cave where they see Rhaika Lei making a campfire and meditating. You can rest with him. Upon interacting with him, he just opens one of his eyes, but says nothing, and goes back to normal. Behind him, there\u2019s a door you can go into. It\u2019s a gorgeous place, reminiscent of an old Catholic Church. At the center, there\u2019s a small statue and sword that is embedded into the chest of a small girl. It\u2019s a human girl. This is a cutscene. You can take it out, but Rhaika Lei will rush in and throw a dagger at your face. He doesn\u2019t talk again, but you do duke it out again. If you win, he staggers back. He chokes on his own words. You pull out the sword. \u201cWho dares disturb my slumber?\u201d Blah blah blah. Rhaika Lei spits out a black glob, which manifests itself into a spider and crawls into the statue. He starts coughing and sputtering. It\u2019s then that the statues eyes light up, and you\u2019re trapped in a dungeon, congrats. There\u2019s a broken fridge in there which flickers to life. You have to pay though. lol. Rhaika Lei is unconscious beside you, but he\u2019s holding a USB which you can insert into a cyborg. It details the tale of Kei, Kai, and Pyrrhon\u2019s conquest against God. It brings into question that there is more than known. Rhaika Lei snaps the USB out of you, then runs away. When you see him next, he\u2019s inserted it into an old mech, which he tries to use to fight you, but is stricken down by Kai, who descends down. \u201cThere is no need for your services, Rhaika Lei. You have done well. And you four\u2026 why have you summoned me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cYou expelled a curse for..?\u201d \u201cFor fun.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d Kai slumps down. \u201c\u2026 Do you need my help?\u201d \u201cYeah, wanna stop a world leader with us?\u201d Gamma jokes. Kai laughs and says sure. As the party member screen opens, it\u2019s cut in half. Kai is sputtering for breath. Her blood leaks into Rhaika Lei\u2019s dead corpse.","title":"I want"},{"location":"Bits/Story/SPACE%20MONKEY/#prequel-story-lore","text":"(my first draft,, i lost the other one) XD It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Earth, in 2XXX. 2012, God fell from the heavens. Angels crashed and burned, and all left behind in the slaughter was a small, gleaning green gem. That\u2019s the PRODIGAL CORE, rumored to be the Core of life itself, the heart of God Himself. From the \u201crapture\u201d, as it was called, 75% of Earth was wiped out. 75% of Earth is \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d, and 25% is all under control of Pyrrhon . Pyrrhon\u2019s the maniacal maniac who harnessed the full power of the PRODIGAL CORE and brought Earth from the depths of hell: for a cost. All you need to know is now, Pyrrhon is in complete and total control of earth and its inhabitants. She runs \u201cOZ\u201d, the world IS OZ. There may be a government, but OZ holds so much power that they are completely powerless. Should OZ be brought down, so would the entire economy of the planet. Pyrrhon is a scientist, as mentioned. She and her friend, Reever, specifically had an interest in human experimentation. One of my many interests is human cloning! You might be able to see where this is going. All clones and nuclear experiments are done on small asteroid planets. One particularly noted is called FUTURE, where a lot of clones are produced. you might see the name \u201cGamma\u201d mentioned\u2014 she is a clone from here! In OZ, there\u2019s sub-categories. One of these sub categories is the NATIONAL GUARDIAN team. A national guardian is basically the only good job you can get without nepotism. On the outside, you fight. Defend the country. Become police, etc. that\u2019s it. Then you join the National guardian team. \u2014\u2014 It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Marian signs away to the National Guardian\u2014 a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him. He is placed in a group with a grumpy old man as his leader, and another boy, named Khan. Khan has joined hte national guardian team to garner funds for his sister, who has unfortunately died before this point but now he can\u2019t really leave. It\u2019s here that they\u2019re given a CORE A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There\u2019s a rumor that Pyrrhon was the one who killed God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it? A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action. Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN\u2019s whole lifetime can\u2019t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful. You level up your CORE using other\u2019s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth. You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE\u2019s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it. The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist. Now, in order to clone, you need eggs to produce them in. A girl named Chou is a donor, and has been for the past year or so. She\u2019s developed a platonic relationship with Khan, so he lives on for her. Anyway Anyway I forgot most of what happens in the prequel story, but blah blah blah immortality blah blah blah, Khan and Marian are homoerotic enemies blah blah blah Chou joins their team,here\u2019s where things get really bad. Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Whether it be his hard head and big muscles or his strange moral compass, she loves him. And she can do whatever she wants with him. \u201cIt doesn't have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon, \u201cIt just has to be you .\u201d \u2026. On November 12, 2XXX, a child is born. That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. He goes on his last mission with Khan and Chou, putting down a rebellion against Oz by a small group called The Last Hope, and Marian is so DONE. He gazes into Nea\u2019s eyes, He realizes that he really does love Nea. Marian refuses to fight from this point on. He gives his magically-infused scarf to Khan, a soft kiss, and then runs into the night. Khan can only stare in awe. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201dI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. (first dra Pre-Established Basically, Khan and Marian were lumped in with this grumpy ass old man. I think Pyrrhon saw their backgrounds (Khan joined to get funds for his little sister, who was ill) and Marian ran away from his religious training and said \u201cfuck you brah\u201d so she put them with the worst possible guy. So this grumpy old man worked their asses off, to try to get into this huge competition in an arena, so that they\u2019d become National guardians. So they train and train and hate each other and love each other a little, and they end up winning that competition and make it into the national guardian association. Khan becomes kind of an egotistical BITCH at this time and leaves Marian who kind of set him up for the final blow which had them win. Marian sulks around, and he wanders back to his old hut with his master, and oh my god he\u2019s fuckign dead :sob: He doesn\u2019t even tell Khan, he just buries his master by himself. While in the forest, he meets this tiny little girl named Chou. She\u2019s bright blue (like gamma) and missing one eye. She\u2019s relaly, really scared like trembling shaking crying .. he feels pity for her and takes her to the infirmary. She actually thinks that Marian is Khan for some reason, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Anyway, it turns out that Khan\u2019s sister actually fucking died a long time ago, so he took Chou under his wing to take care of. But since he\u2019s been too busy doing whatever shit he does, she\u2019s been lonely. Marian like an idiot, leaves her, and brawls with Marian for like, three hours. He does actually apologize and realize his wrongs, goes to Chou, and they both \u201cadopt\u201d her, basically. Chou is part of the genetic testing batch and was chosen to be a gene donor to some of the clones, so she\u2019s whisked away. They both stop by a bar and kinda go over what\u2019s happened to them so far. How far they\u2019ve come. How they\u2019re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. Actually, before this time, Marian and Pyrrhon had their, uhm! Their run in. So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. Anyway, they end up putting TLH to rest here, and Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019d say. But it can happen! I promise you.\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian joins a small temple in the middle of nowhere. Climbs up the ranks. brings Nea, who;d been born, with him. And Pyrrhon.. OLD DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. After Nea escapes from Future, she has a run in with some guy and Point helps her get a CORE outta one of the PiBots. So, she does that. Gamma comes along and screams, outta my way! She takes that CORE. Point tells Nea to get out. if you get out, you can\u2019t because Gamma challenges you and is like \u201cIzzat point? Goddamn! He really won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d \u201cFive second rule, yk? Gotta get it fresh.\u201d She jams your transmissions and then you fight. The same thing happens if you walk towards her, just with different intro dialogue. *YOU CAN ONLY DEFEAT GAMMA USING A BLOCKBUSTER, or whatever the equal is. It\u2019s because she\u2019s metal and she\u2019s weak to Magic. Dream magic and reg Magic should be a thing. Nea uses Dream Magic She gives up after the first hit from the blockbuxaster and then Gamma just leaves because her pride is hurt. She throws you the CORE and hops away. Okay so you leave into the forest and then uh oh, it\u2019s Gamma. She staggers towards you and begs for a truce. She even gives you her powerbank, which she\u2019s using to power her PiCORE, since she has no external energy to grab. You guys can talk. You can ask her how she knows Point, or who she is. She dances around answering about Point, but they were in the resistance before together :) they tried getting together, and actually kissed! But Gamma is a lesbian (point is gay too) so they don\u2019t really like each other, but they\u2019re just too embarrassed. They kissed before the resistance force shelter was bombed. OH OH SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT where you\u2019re from! \u201cThe over world..? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d She gets all sentimental on you. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like? I hear it\u2019s being overrun by politicians right now\u2026 Oh, really? There\u2019s really no safe space on Earth anymore, huh?\u201d \u201cYou need to talk to Point? .. Oh.\u201d She gives you her powerbank (like just shoves it in her hands), stating that she doesn\u2019t need it anymore. She needs it to fight, but she says that it\u2019s getting harder to fight. It\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m so tired.. Gamma suddenly collapses. A small hologram states that she\u2019s very low on power. Nea just tucks Gamma into the bed next to her. The powerbank and her transmitter are on the side, she hasn\u2019t used it yet. She kinda thKhans about it, before drifting off to sleep\u2026 HOLY FUCK ITS PRODIGAL Prodigal comes along and fucking BURNS the forest down. Nea slams the powerbank back into Gamma, who gets up. She\u2019s stuck in her PiBot mode since Nea is bad with computers. Gamma scares Prodigal off, and then there\u2019s a shot of her amidst the fire, and looking back, like the eclair cyborg picture I had. She extends a hand, and they fly off. You can either get Nea\u2019s route maybe or you can get Tsao and Khan maybe.. Pre-DEMOlition Bijyun opening: A few glitches in the opener when you log in and when you immediately leave afterward. Gamestyle: A short hack-n-slash tutorial. Quick-paced and gets you over the basics, which include: Grappling hooks Basic movement controls Extremely basic fighting controls + crouch/crouch attacks Not too long for the tut sequence, but a little longer for the fighting sequence. \u201cWhew! You okay there, Gamma? Back on track, \u2018Kay? Get going!\u201d Afterward, you get a semi-glitched cutscene, and Gamma falls to the ground. Guess what happened here? Pyrrhon glitched Gamma\u2019s memories! All glitching is actually the memories she had with Prodigal She lands in Marian\u2019s abandoned temple with her motorcycle, the Comet. Cut to Gamma at her new job. \u201c\u2026 And now I\u2019m here. Working under the same person, same conditions, just somewhere else.\u201d A testing sequence, 1v1 battle against a harder foe + a few troop waves. As she tosses it up into the air (carelessly), it\u2019s shot out of her hands and Prodigal fucking eats it. Anim.cut where Gamma loses her job. She\u2019s pretty unreliable anyway. \u201cBut I\u2014!\u201d \u201cOn , you failed to retrieve \u2019s heart\u201d On ___ you took Lock\u2019s left lung for your own personal gain\u201d Etc. it\u2019s actually extremely funny how unreliable she is. They throw her over the side of the fucking building because she gets into a fight She lands, hard. She\u2019s gasping for air, but somehow still clinging onto the life she once had. \u2026 and then Nea falls next to her. She isn\u2019t in as much pain as Gamma, but that throw was supposed to kill, so thank God for Gamma being there to break her fall. \u201c\u2026 Got fired too?\u201d Says Gamma. Nea gasps for air. \u201c\u2026 yeah.\u201d They just kind of, sit there. It\u2019s raining, they\u2019re basically going to die. There\u2019s nowhere to go. They\u2019re both bleeding out into each other. That\u2019s what Nea says, at least. Gamma tries to keep them both awake, but they both end up collapsing from blood loss. Potential Shenx meeting instead of Huangzhi, who takes them both and says \u201chey Prodigal is being really mean to us and we need you guys to take her out.\u201d Gamma was an experiment to make a clone as \u2018human\u2019 as possible. Prodigal was the second part to make the clone as robotic as possible. With this, they studied how they fared in battle situations. Prodigal was genuinely fucking FASCINATED with Gamma, like obsessively, and stalked her around. Gamma really hated Prodigal for that. Actually, Gamma was barely aware of Prodi\u2019s existence. Pyrrhon did everything in her power to keep them separated. This is where the \u201cProdigal Boss\u201d Lore comes into play. She finds Gamma with Nea, who she sort of just observes from a distance. Think Hornet, from Hollow Knight, or Road, from D. Gray-Man. Yes, she causes all sorts of issues, but they never come face to face. But tensions build. At the end of a chase scene, Nea stabs down Prodigal. Prodigal doesn\u2019t even fight, and only falls limply to the ground.

Post Demolition Introduce Prodial!~ REWRITING HEAVILY DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you.

Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you?

But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. Meanwhile, with Gamma.. Running through the forest. She ate a mysterious fruit (tomato) earlier, and is beginning to choke. She\u2019s not allergic\u2014 did you know thai8t Clones have extremely strict dietary restrictions? Ref to the acid reflux. Someone (who is a little easily seen from the background) hops out and basically like, fucking guts her. I\u2019m kidding. What she does is open the latch on her stomach which pours out some of the stomach acid. Gamma shakily gets up. \u201c\u2026 wh-who..?!\u201d \u201cYer lucky you\u2019re a gen 3 clone. Any higher an\u2019 ya would\u2019ve died already.\u201d Gamma\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re a c\u2014!!\u201d \u201cSame batch as you. Humanities, Div 3. Pleased to meetcha.\u201d Honey shakes her hand. \u201cYou can call me Honey. \u2018S what my friend calls me. Any other name an\u2019 I gut ya you for parts, \u2018Kay?\u201d \u201c\u2026 Gamma.\u201d \u201cA pleasure. Where ya headed?\u201d \u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The story so far is explained with a fade to black. Honey puts her hands behind her back. \u201cYou wanna find \u2018em?\u201d Gamma nods. \u201cSaw sum suspicious figures while I was fishin\u2019. Old fart and bratty monk.\u201d \u201cMonk?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got the marking\u2019s of one. Star an\u2019 refined magic an everything. \u201c\u2026 Huh.\u201d \u201cProlly resigned if she\u2019s talkin with you. | Ah, look at that. We\u2019re here.\u201d (Opening to the new island, the one where Honey and Constantine are. The one that\u2019s a Baguio/Bontoc replica). \u201cBut-but\u2014!\u201d \u201cShh. Yer injured. I\u2019ve adopted you. I\u2019m obligated to.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat, wanna go fight?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just leave them!\u201d Honey kind of stares at her for a second, and then punches her. She flies across the map and ragdoll collides with the window barriers. Very loose physics. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even beat me, how do you expect to save your friends?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cSee? Okay. I get a discount, since my girlfriend works there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Khan and Nea are tied up and about to be thrown into the incinerator. Khan says something about her father, and then\u2014! \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me and not her,\u201d says Nea. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t see me like this,\u201d says Khan, to Marian (depending on who you\u2019re playing as). Honey and Gamma show up, and you do an equally fun aoe damage dungeon with them instead. Khan and Honey give each other glares at the end but Nea and Gamma are happy to see each other again. \u201cSo, now what?\u201d Gamma and Nea sit at the edge of the cliff and point towards Pyrrhon\u2019s empire in the distant summer sunset. \u201cThere.\u201d Cool perspective shot of all of them, then the chapter ends. One Shots and Whatnot Species Chibao (Khan, Clementine, and Rhaikha-Lei). ChiBao\u2019s live for a very long time, they\u2019re like the elf equivalent in CORE. It is a male dominated culture, with women being very rare and held at utmost care. When you think of magic capabilities, these are the ones you think of. These are the pioneers of magic creation, even the controversial refined magic. From the start to the end, magic has run through the veins of the ChiBao. Stats They tend to lean towards speed and offense with low Defense and HP. This is because they don\u2019t usually get hit in general and use ranged attacks most often. This can vary between personalities. Physical Appearances Easily defined by their slender figures and pure white eyes, the ChiBao originated as a small tribe around Southeast Asia. They wear makeup made of ashes around their eyes. On occasion, they will wear the ashes of their enemies when going into war. Traditional clothing includes long, flowing hair (typically braids) and long scarves or other forms of clothing. This symbolizes their long lives. Due to their environment, their colors are usually warm/brownish colors. Their hands are absurdly large and calloused. They don\u2019t shave off their callouses, since it serves as a natural protection against their strong magic. History The ChiBao are credited for the first recordings of asexual reproduction that wasn\u2019t cloning. This was later tabooed. Their cells are completely incompatible with other species, so they can\u2019t have other mixes of children. They eat the other ones up like acid. Consequently, there are very little ChiBao in existence today, so they\u2019re held in generally high regard. They are a very \u2018purist\u2019 tribe, since they are physically incapable of mixing with other species. Their religion, however, is open to any species, gender, and color. Chiru (Nea, Chasmus, Marian, and Shenx). More magic-oriented than Inozha, but much less than the ChiBao. The \u2018unicorns\u2019 of CORE. They are so widespread, that there is no one tradition that the Chiru adapt. They instead adapt of wherever they are staying in. The most average of all the species. Stats It varies between personality, but they tend to lean more towards offense OR defense. There is not one or the other. They tend to use short-ranged attacks due to their size. Physical appearance It\u2019s very common for them to be short and stubby legged, but a few have had absurd growth spurts which boost them to normal height. Since their legs are abnormal, they are prone to injury. Many people have surgery or \u2018splints\u2019 inserted into their legs, like Huangzhi. Nea simply doesn\u2019t run very often for this fact. They have a lot of color variation, but go more towards cool, dark colors. Chiru are known for having the fastest hair growth out of anyone else. History They originally began as a small nomad tribe who picked up various other wanderers of other cultures and species. Because of this.. cesspool, they eventually grew strong together and took over large parts of the Earth. they are so widespread that there is no stereotype that could fit any of them. Inozha (Constantine, Shou, Pyrrhon, Han, Hal, Clementine, and Coda) The secondary average tribe, but with no magic. Absolutely none. The \u2018red blooded Americans\u2019. Also extremely widespread, but stereotyped to be big, burly, and aggressive. The \u201cearth ponies\u201d. stats Extreme offense! It\u2019s very, very rare for them ever to rely on anything else! Brute force, amiriight?! Physical Appearance Extreme color variety, from skin color to colors. These are the species that popularized clothing. Very fashionable and adaptable. They have small bodies but are extremely quick and powerful. history They came in very late to the whole Stickfigure sub species scene, and when they did, they brought up the Industrial Revolution. They brought clothes, colonization, money, technology, etc to both magic oriented tribes. Because of their alliance with the Chiru, Chiru lost touch of their extreme magic capabilities over time. The Inozha are heavily credited towards .. capitalism and business. Nai (Honey, Gamma, Kei, Kai, Prodigal, Python, Huangzhi, and Chou). A simple term used to describe those who don\u2019t fall into any of those categories. Everyone in here is mostly a clone.","title":"Prequel Story + LORE"},{"location":"Bits/Story/Story%20Notes/","text":"Sosolensk Moniqua Xinakin Comakin Theta Shenx To obtain the better engine you need to get the core that Theta is guarding.

They are the CORE and in order to get it, they have to be killed. Comakin knows he\u2019s going to die since Xinakin is going to try to devour his half of the CORE to go back to being one single person. it\u2019s either Gamma, Nea, Constantine, and Honeycakes (and I guess shenx) kill them, or Huangzhi and Theta do it. Comakin has unkind things to say bout Gamma and Honey because theyre a clones. However he\u2019s okay with Shenx and Constantine. Actually Huangzhi manages to kill Xinakin and take out her CORE, but Constantine manages to take it back. He charges it using Theta\u2019s CORE actaually so they dont need to kill Comakin. Comakin lives with Shenx until he dies, basically. Shenx took him in to work as a bartender. When Comakin escaped, he was taken in by Moniqua and . Um the other people who live there. The village chiefs. Comakin knows where Khan lives which is how he got into a business relationship with Shenx in the first place. Xinakin is a pretty passive presence. Comakin doesn\u2019t like Prodigal or 07 Angel because they ran a siege on their town for supplies. And he really wasn\u2019t the biggest fan. He is online friends with Miyo. Fun fact, when you finish the ship, Comakin declines to go with you . He says he\u2019d rather spend the rest of his life down here instead of going up in the air.

From greed came war, and from war came disease. Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body. The only things left were the Rumors which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures. They\u2019d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought. In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End. The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens. The rapture had begun. Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it\u2019s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped. As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton. The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God. It\u2019s the ultimate mother\u2019s womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it. The last living ruler of Beau\u2019s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger. A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis. That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon\u2019s Golden Rule. She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch. Everything seemed fine. And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant. Everything has since been stuffed under the rug. Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug. To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too. She began to become generally.. extremely mentally unstable at this time. lol. With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning. Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously long, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been. Pyrrhon enacted the National Guardian Security system, which would put everyone in poorer families to work, specifically ones she didn\u2019t like. (Marian and Khan were born at this time). With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments done on other people. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person. Pyrrhon. From her goal of reversing Beau\u2019s tyranny, she had become even worse. It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous \u2018clone army\u2019. This marked the years until now as \u201cThe Age of Eugenics\u201d, because that\u2019s what it was and still is. And everything\u2019s crumbling, all the same. Will another leader repeat the cycle, or will the Earh crumble into its long awaited demise?\u2026 Pyrrhon and Kei She found Kai\u2019s counterpart, Kei, inside of God\u2019s heart. Kei is the last living human, ever. She\u2019s managed to keep her frozen in time using a mixture of her own methods and God\u2019s magic. Using Kei and Chou (the genetically perfect being), she plans to repopulate the Earth with clones where no one can be sad and where everything is under her control to prevent every single war. To prevent any differneciality, to prevent any destructions, to prevent anything from ever going wrong. If everyone is the same, then nothing bad will happen, and she will do that using Kei. This Earth is just an experiment. She inserted a single Kei gene which didn\u2019t reproduce nor destroy into PRODIGAL. She chose her because prodigal was so fuckign corrupted that the Kei gene didnt eat away at her, but also didn\u2019t repopulate itself. However it was kind of an infinite energy source so Prodigal was able to wreck mass havoc on society (If we continue using Balach as a story element, he is the reason Prodigal was unleashed. Because in a very VERY old version, Shenx had sealed her away in a forest). But by this Earth being an experiment, she\u2019s testing what genetic effects work, better brainwashing techniques, basically developing the clones into perfection. Also she\u2019s going to wipe out everyone and repopulate it with just the clones and Kei. Prodigal only had the Kei gene inserted once Gamma escaped, so she was still able to be conscious because she wanted to find Gamma. Pyrrhon\u2019s obsession with Marian came from Kei glancing in his direction. The reason she did was because she liked his bright hair tie. Pyrrhon saw this as a prophecy. She woudl be a Scientologist probaby/ Pyrrhon, as a child, was relatively ignored. Her real name is unknown She had three older brothers and two parents. Two older brothers have moved to get higher education, but the third stayed in the nearby area since he got accepted into the aerospace industry. Pyrrhon, initially, wasn't super great at school, but her brother took her into his aerospace workplace and she tell in love. She got insane results and actually graduated college early to get that job with him. (Her parents neglected her a lot. No matter what she did, she couldn't do it). So after about a year, they plan to send her brother to space, since he's very physically active and good at this stuff. That day was November 10, 203 BFC. God's CORE fell to the ground and intercepted her brother. He died as God came down from heaven. All that was left was the CORE, which had landed right in her hands. So she got to work, and built her empire. Her parents took credit for her work, so she killed them and used them for experimentation. It's the first time she realized that she has that power, and then, discovered the work of early human eugenics, and, with the CORE, set out to create the perfect society to erase all pain. and so.. Marian is not a very good person to be honest, and never was. His origin story lands himself as.. well, he ran away from home because he hates religion, joined the army, became even worse, and got worse. He joins the army at 13, not because he supports Pyrrhon but because he just hates his church. He doesn\u2019t really know what he\u2019s been getting into, but at least he got a cupcake for registering. However the person who made them mistook the sugar for salt and so it\u2019s incredibly salty. Marian trains with Khan and this crippling old man who is not FLLFFL because FL is a nice person, and his mentor is a piece of absolute dogshit. Um POTENETIAL SPOILERS: If we go with the \u201cPyrrhon is self aware she is in the game and hacks into the games code to give herself immortality and such\u201d, then their master has also discovered immortality, BUT was later assasinated by Pyrrhon because he was a threat. Him and Khan have an odd homoerotic relationship. Khan joined the army for a noble cause, and they both detest each other because: Marian: Khan is an egotistical, stupid, know-it-all bastard! He thinks he\u2019s sooooo great!!! Khan: Marian is a disgrace who brings SHAME upon our entire species! I\u2019m embarrassed to have to share a PLANET with him! He is so selfish and uncouth, what a brat! Their master likes to joke around and tell them, \u201cjust fuck already\u201d which they both genuinely do hate, but theyre both so unsocialized they do .. um, nefarious activities with each other as teenagers. At ~age 16, they get into their first mission, which is with Padme and Uche to stop a horde of rouge clones on the Phisit mountains. I have the mission planed out and the entire prequel story is either going to be an RPG, book, or a DLC addition. But anyway the mission was a death mission in disguise, but they were able to do it so well that.. well, it worked out! And they made quite a name for themselves Fast forward a few missions later, Padme and Uche were sent away to an overseas mission where they were later reported as dead. This is where the beginning of the end starts. While leaving from a particularly rough mission, Marian and Khan head to a bar. As they\u2019re there, they spot Chou (you can read more information about her on her wiki page) and recruit her because shes a perfect genetic being. Blah blah blah stuff happens here, Marian has his epiphany and becomes a better person through Chou and finally discovering empathy for other people. Khan has the opposite effect where he loses his morality and becomes a selfish brat, like how Marian was at the beginning of the story. Ok, Khan joined the army initially to get funding to save his little sister. He\u2019s the second youngest out of 16 siblings, and his younger sibling is very very sick. While he did obtain the money, when he sent it she was already dead.. she died right after he left. So he\u2019s quite distraught. And Chou looks.. way too similar to his sister.. He doesn\u2019t do anything necessarily bad to Chou, but he just forgets about her Marian and what brought him to his current state of power. Et cetera. I dont want to talk about this portion of the story s ince Its my weakest point. However, Chou almost dies because Khan decides to be an asshole and stupid, and Marian fights basically to the death to save her. He\u2019s had enough of Khan\u2019s bullshit and it ends up resulting in this HUGE fight with the two of them where they\u2019re both gravely injured. By this point, Pyrrhon has caught notice of Marian. She\u2019s in a big less power than she is now, since this was ~70 years ago. Pyrrhon calls Marian up to her office. She\u2019s fascinated by him. Maybe it\u2019s his absolute lack of a moral compass or his fighting prowess, but no matter. Now, Pyrrhon\u2019s all powerful, and her obsession with Kei has caused her to slip, and she can do whatever she wants with him\u2026 \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon. \u201cIt just has to be you.\u201d That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. After he was released from being tortured by Pyrrhon and Mutilaiton, he went to that same bar he met Chou at Consequentially, Khan is also at that same bar. They talk Reminisce Remind themselves Of who they were in the past. No one believes Marian about Pyrrhon and Nea. But Khan does. Anyway it\u2019s a bit icky here. TW for more dubious activities. Marian is traumatized and extremely mentally unstable. So is Khan but he\u2019s started to chill out after the whole Chou ordeal. He feels a responsibility to help out Marian since he\u2019s going through so much. Marian is really hyper sexual after being raped, basically, by Pyrrhon and Khan has to deal with the brunt of that. He doesn\u2019t know if he likes Marian, but .. it does feel nice. But, does it really? he feels a responsibility to bear the cross with Marian. Is it not his fault that this occurred..? So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. And so, Marian went on a mission (his last mission). He took her, Khan, and Chou with him to finish up the mission. The mission was to basically put down a rebellion/rebel group named \u201cThe Last Hope\u201d. Now, Shenx.. His parents were DEEPLY involved in TLH, and so was he. He was a fierce warrior even at like. Age ten. So of course he fought with them! Khan was filled with rage. Fueled by his own bloodlust and his rage from Chou, from Pyrrhon, from Marian, from what he loved about Marian, what he hated about himself. With that, he slaughtered the entire division by himself. Still in his bloody high, he slashes at a nearby ten-year-old child, leaving a huge gash in the middle of his chest. He slices off his legs, one by one. He runs his sword along Shenx\u2019s arms shoulders, running the blade in-between his shoulder sockets, watching the blood dribble along the blade, into the sweet, sweet Earth, and\u2014 Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019d say. But it can happen! I promise you.\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201cI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. The last remnants of human history, gone. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. Five years later, no one knows it was her. Not that many people knew that temples still existed, anyway. Much less that one burned down in the middle of nowhere. She attends schools and colleges, since what else could you do? But slave away her magic for a machine which rejected the very idea of her? Nea only bites her teeth and steels herself. No point in fighting a losing battle. Nea as a child,, She\u2019s like, Really self-centered and quite manipulative, she used her looks and good reputation to gain attention from people around her to give her stuff. She bought a lot of stupid items. She was particularly good at love bombing and gaslighting She was okay at school, for a time. She had a small phase where she rebelled (they had the money to just stop..) and dropped out of school for a while to do random shit, like sports. But her dad forced her back in. Even as a kid, she was really loud. She didn\u2019t cry but she wailed, and she wailed a lot. She was a stubborn little brat who always wanted her way. Quite literally no empathy for other people, she was one of THOSE popular kids. Nea was taken out of her last two years of middle school to do intensive temple training, which actually brought her back into shape and she became a little less spoiled. She became good at fighting and was now really educated in religion and everything because she literally worked her ASS off (out of complete spite, there was another girl she didn\u2019t like in her program). Her dad congratulated her, which gave her the confidence to start trying in school. In high school, she was like twilight sparkle but more sociable. She was \u201cpopular\u201d, but mostly because the popular kids there liked her because she\u2019d let them cheat off her homework. She went to the same school Regina went to, fun fact. Anyway, she ended up getting a boyfriend. She thought that she could easily take advantage of his new money for her own advantage, but no! Nea actually got uh, into a very bad and toxic relationship! I mean, sure, she had \u201crelationships\u201d but none of those guys could really \u201chandle her\u201d (poor and she was really energetic and got too excited a lot). He kinda, like, used her for her body and turned all of her previous manipulation tactics against her, so she was in a terrible state until she was taken out AGAIN for more religious training, which she was pretty happy to do. So for three years, she didn\u2019t step foot outside of her temple. She was in a pretty nasty mental state, and it\u2019s not like her dad really helped her with that. Marian doesn\u2019t know how to deal with kids so he\u2019s kinda emotionally neglectful and lashes out at them a lot. He\u2019s actually a little abusive, so Nea had a bad relationship with him. He also hated her because of what happened with Pyrrhon, but he was getting better slowly and was now (badly) trying to spark a relationship with her. However she rejected 99% of attempts (except one, which was near the end). So she mastered the art of Refined Magic, good job, Nea! By this time, she\u2019d graduated high school solely off of religious exemption and now worked at her temple for one more year, until Pyrrhon invaded it, and then she burned the temple down,, Mostly because she had almost never suffered the consequences of her own actions before. Anything broken could always be replaced with her money, but her father is gone, and years of history is now ash, and Pyrrhon\u2019s after her, and she\u2019s completely useless now. She never talked about her religious background, but bought herself a fake identity after working a year or so in the underworld. She went to school for engineering and minored in music while working her side job in the underworld, But like, she got fired.. and like, she met Gamma.. and like, got kicked out of school because she\u2019s rumored to be dead.. After Marian\u2019s death she became really quiet and completely reconstructed herself as a being. She\u2019s also really NARCISITIC STILL HONESTLY FUCKING LEARN!!! But she leans on the independent, \u201cI\u2019m better than you and you will taint me by your presence!\u201d Ermmm tl;dr when Marian was taking Nea through the snow, her heart became extremely weak and damaged so she does canonically have a mechanical heart because it can\u2019t beat on its own She also has re-enforced legs to help her stand on her own, otherwise she\u2019d be crippled And anyway, remember Shenx? So Shenx\u2019s whole mission is fueled by revenge to kill Khan, and consequently Pyrrhon\u2019s empire. He built his mech out of the remains of what was left in TLH and the dead clones that his parents killed. And went to the underground.. People generally respected this 12 year old boy walking in with no legs and a mech doing all sorts of crazy shit. He met lots of good friends (one in particular named Sho) and managed to scrape together enough money and people to revive TLH. It\u2019s an underground operation still, but they do operate. Tl;dr shenx is mad at Khan for cutting his legs off, revives a rebellion group out of spite. Right now they operate out of his bar, The Slaughterhouse. Sho works there as a chef. Shes unironically good at her job, she just hates talking to people. When you talk to her in game, it takes of -1 HP.TLH has actually made some progress dismantling Pyrrhon\u2019s power (particularly in their area and in the underground). It\u2019s all under the table deals, so people are currently under the assumption that TLH had ended a very long time ago and never exists. TLH stands for \u201cThe Last Hope\u201d, which I forgot to mention earlierShenx actually discovered Marian and Khan again through Nea. I mean, Nea was Marian\u2019s daughter that night. so he wasn\u2019t very pleased to find that out. \u2026 And then there\u2019s Honeycakes. Honey doesn\u2019t have much to her, so she says. Born in 3.0\u2019s \u201chumanitarian cloning program\u201d, she was no 3 out of 9. The smaller the number, the older the body skeleton. Honey was born into the body of a 25-year-old male. He\u2019s Omega, he\u2019s the world\u2019s best clone. Honey had the most of the PRODIGAL CORE inserted into him, giving him insane amounts of strength. With this, he was easily trusted and let into areas she shouldn\u2019t be. There\u2019s a reason why they try to dampen the intellect of clones nowadays. Pyrrhon is a scientist. Like most scientists, she creates experiments. To test emotional intelligence and bonding under artificial stress. Pyrrhon\u2019s theory: \u201cIf we can make even broken clones function as a unit, we can make anyone loyal.\u201d The Scrapcore unit\u2014Nikita, Adam, Omega, and Kit\u2014were dropped into a controlled \u201cwasteland\u201d sim zone. Fake urban ruins. No food, minimal gear. Monitored 24/7. Neural data streamed into Pyrrhon\u2019s labs. No win condition. The test was meant to collapse after 30 days, with behavioral breakdowns studied for refinement. Begin. INSERT STUFF HERE they get out. The camera feeds fuzzed. Pyrrhon marked them as \u201cLOST ASSETS.\u201d But she was still watching. In the forgotten sector, surrounded by discarded tech, malfunctioning AIs, and broken clone pods, the four made a base. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. The system didn\u2019t know what to do with them. They became something of an urban legend among failed clones: a ghost team. Unstable but free. They weren\u2019t a rebellion, at least not in Pyrrhon\u2019s eyes. They were a malfunction. She saw Omega\u2019s rebellion not as failure\u2014but defiance. Personal betrayal. So she took it personally. Pyrrhon decided to test her new weapon: a miniaturized, precision-targeted doomsday laser, a condensed nuke, designed to melt cities from orbit. Testing it on Omega was the perfect test. Pyrrhon grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s see what hope looks like under 8 trillion kelvin.\u201d Omega was locked in a containment chamber\u2014torture-level clean, clinical, and pressurized. As most laboratories are. And the laser fires up. Omega looks at Pyrrhon. Pyrrhon only smiles. the machine whirs in the back, heat gurgling from its engine and seeping out into the tip, ready to\u2014! --\u2014- Pyrrhon sat with her torso scratched from falling debris. Blood trickled down onto the floor. Her first injury this century. Omega, carried in the arms of Nikita, went into an escape pod. But Omega looked back at the moment of the laser\u2019s first test-firing. Even just one glance at the beam\u2019s ignition\u2014through transparent shielding\u2014was enough to permanently destroy his eyesight. Retinas flash-boiled. Optic nerves scorched. A scream cut short by shock. \u2026 A biotech-enhanced spatial sensor was surgically implanted in her skull. It translates physical surroundings into a 3D representation in her brain\u2014like a sonar map + LIDAR system. It\u2019s \u201csight,\u201d but not the same. No colors. No light. Only shapes, distance, motion, and pressure. He can, in fact, see, but everything looks like a haunting, low-poly wireframe world. No longer he be able to gaze into the eyes of \u2026 Were they his friends in the first place? They\u2019re on Earth. Now what? Omega: \u201cWe need a chain of command. We do what I say or we die.\u201d Nikita: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a leader. We need a plan. You\u2019re not it.\u201d Adam: \u201dYou act like we even have a chance.\u201d Kit: \u201c\u2026\u201d Fight here Honey looks around, and sees nothing but a world of everything he\u2019s ever hated. And he\u2019s sick of it. One small fight into a small rebellion, now he\u2019s chained up to the wall and tortured until she can barely breathe. Three days until execution. Honey has one last look at her original form, her mother core. Two days until execution. Honey begins to ponder. One day until execution. Then, nothing at all. No one, at least in the general public, knows what happened or where she went; All they know was that 3 PiBots were torn apart and that Pyrrhon\u2014 The original war leader Pyrrhon\u2014 was injured. Pyrrhon said she wanted to be there when \"Omega's futile resistance fell\", and stood right in front of Honey taunting her. But Honey broke out and injured her. The laser was fired and Omega was nowhere to be found and is presumed dead. No one had ever done that before. (Insert Adam kit Nikita) Honey works alone in the CORE equivalent of Baguio (I HEART BAGUIO!!!!!!). She works with a street chef. She goes out to get materials because of her unmatched strength. She brings back fish and works in the farms (steals from the farms) and cuts and prepares them for less than minimum wage. She\u2019s kind of miserable,, her boss treats her badly,,, but also, she\u2019s a clone and clones have extremely bad reputation in that area. Due to construction and lack of funding she can\u2019t get out, so she\u2019s stuck there. Regina goes to her stand to buy some materials. Honey feels bad because Regina is like, 300 php off so she gives her a small piece of candy for free. Her boss did NOT like that!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE IN CRIPPLING FINANCIAL DEBT AND CANT AFFORD THAT!! Honey gets the equivalent of like, public execution with her boss :sob:. The nearby people notice that her muscles and fat are artificial and she just kinda, slumps and hides and continues to skin the fish she just got. It begins to rain. The train goes down because of it, so she can\u2019t get into her apartment. \u201cIs this the life I fought to live\u2026?\u201d This starts her motivation to make sure other people don\u2019t live like she has. Regina is walking to her restaurant, and she spots Honey sitting there. She offers her an umbrella and Honey just stares at her. \u201c\u2026 That was really good sisig,\u201d says Regina. \u201cEven if you mostly sell fish.\u201d Honey is flushed and looks to the side. \u201cWhy do you let him treat you like that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have a chioce. There\u2019s no where else to go. | I\u2019m a clone. You know that. Why do you continue to speak to me?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Regina turns to a nearby vendor who\u2019s walking by, selling Taho. She orders two of them and hands one to Honey. \u201cRepayment,\u201d says Regina. \u201cI got paid earlier.\u201d Honey takes the Taho without a word, but doesn\u2019t eat it. Shitty beta I made in 2 seconds You know,\u201d says Regina. \u201cMy place, uh.. I think you\u2019d go well there.\u201d \u201cEven if my body is 90% metal?\u201d \u201cWhat does that matter? | You paid for my meal. You were beaten for it. It\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d \u201c\u2018S not yer fault,, what\u2019s the point of gettin\u2019 mad over that?\u201d \u201cI mean.. if anything, you\u2019ve changed my view on, uh, cloning, and.. we need new recipes there, anyway.\u201d \u201cYour business will go down if you have me there, I\u2014.. I can\u2019t do that to you, y\u2019 know? | Yer too nice, you don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m offering you a job.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me.\u201d \u201cWe have protection.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Regina takes off her scarf and wraps it around Honey\u2019s wounds. \u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d says Regina. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cThink of it as repayment,\u201d says Regina. tl;dr Regina feels bad for her and is like, \u201cyou were kinda good at what u do I see ya workin so I think you shoudl get a job, also you shouldn\u2019t let him do that to you\u201d and honey says \u201cbut I\u2019m 90% metal\u201d and Regina says \u201cstfu\u201d So honey is like, eternally grateful ;; the general restaurant is alright, pretty below average but tightly knit. She\u2019s been working there for like, four years? Around this time, two other suspicious clones began to emerge. \u201cThe lives we\u2019ve left behind,\u201d says Prodigal. \u201care nothing. They cannot be worth more than what we are about to do.\u201d Gamma only bites her lip, flicking the visor over her head. \u201cWe will deploy.\u201d Gamma adjusts the straps on her vest. \u201cWe will deploy.\u201d \u201cYou have the map?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Prodigal adjusts her helmet, and looks down upon Gamma. Upon FUTURE and everything and everything in the whole wide world. \u201cLet us begin.\u201d And with that, Prodigal fell into the abyss, crashing into the depths of hell. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.. Ta-ta-ta\u2026 Gamma hops off, soaring beneath the dusty clouds, cold air biting her cheeks. Flimsy, plastic wings flick beneath her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re down?\u201d \u201cAt the core!\u201d Says Prodigal. \u201cGet ready to strike at Sector 3\u2013 the one Marian lives at!\u201d \u201cRoger.\u201d Gamma flicks off her visor, aiming down. Sector 3\u2013 Targeted Area. Deploy? Yes No And Gamma is no more. Broken glass is all she hears. Then silence. One gunshot is all it takes. Gamma flies, dancing on bullets and fire, piercing through dead bodies. Floating amongst the sea of blood below her. Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta.. But one gunshot is all it takes. One gunshot and the whole operation is down. She tries not to think about that part right now. A laser grazes her left cheek. Bam! A machine gone. A machine gun targets her legs. Bam! A master controller, gone. A door, leading to heavens she may never know. Bam! Open. There stands Prodigal, already running along the sidelines, dancing along the ceiling like it\u2019s nothing. Like a spider waltzing amongst its web, grasping bullets and slurs and shouts. She nods at Gamma, who kicks upon the helmet of those beneath her. Bam! Bam! A row taken out, all collapsed into a pathetic pile of limp limbs. Prodigal only smiles back. And they work in synergy, as they always had. Two parts of one whole, unified into one sentient God. No bullets, no organizations can stop them now. Nothing could stop them. And there! Up in the clouds, the light at the end of the tunnel. The outstretched hand of God which gleamed down beneath them, smiling upon them like the warm sun. Gamma\u2019s legs ache, gears screaming in protest, needles piercing her throat as she jumps, higher and higher, Her fingers graze the hinges of the door\u2014 The frame shrieks under her sudden weight, teetering from side to side, wires snapping as Gamma\u2019s arms trembled. please, please, just one more\u2026 just\u2014 just one\u2014! But one gunshot is all it takes. She whips around, seeing Prodigal barreling towards her, Her last hope. Prodigal\u2019s hands outstretch towards hers, her metallic skeleton showing from the sudden jump, her membrane melts off of her skin as she gets closer, closer, Gamma\u2019s fingers brush hers, staining them a deep, black color. BAM! Suddenly, Prodigal\u2019s head jerks forward, and she\u2019s launched into the wall beneath Gamma. One bullet\u2014 Gamma lands\u2014 hard\u2014 on the platform next to Prodigal, which shrieks and trembles under Gamma\u2019s weight. Prodigal\u2014 From above Prodigal comes a metallic arm, which wraps its hideous tendrils around her neck, piercing her membrane and metal. It\u2019s thumbs worm into her eye sockets as she thrashes, cries out in a broken, warbling shriek. She kicks, screams, cries, bleeds to get it off, to stop it from going down her throat. My last hope\u2014 From behind Gamma comes footsteps. God. She gazes down at Gamma not with disgust, but with curiosity. A subtle humanity deep within her half-lidded eyes. Gamma can\u2019t move. Pyrrhon steps closer, heels clacking against the creaky, hollow platform. She glowers down upon Prodigal, and grabs her heart. Never before had Gamma seen something so grotesquely gorgeous. Pyrrhon\u2019s fingers slide between her membrane, stretching out her titanium ribcage with ease. Prodigal shrieks and whines and screams again, her radio crackling from the sudden stress. Her hands graze Prodigal\u2019s CORE. Thumping, humming, breathing, loving, LIFE. THE CORE. The dim light of Prodigal\u2019s last life shines upon Gamma\u2019s bloodied cheeks. Time seemed to stop. it gave off some hideous, electric sensation. Like one that made the hairs on the back of her neck stick up, which made her blood rush, which made her head go dizzy and her chest start to pound. The corners of her vision went blurry, the massacre blending together into one, big, hideous masterpiece. It didn\u2019t feel real, like patterns in some surreal, drug-induced delirium. This was the CORE? It made her sick. Gamma\u2019s legs jerk up involuntarily, grabbing the attention of Pyrrhon. She can\u2019t think. she refuses to. Her hands find the dampened handles of Pyrrhon\u2019s motorcycle, lurching her deep into the depths of space. Her eyes meet Pyrrhon\u2019s. Pyrrhon did nothing. Only stares, deep into Gamma. For the first time in Gamma\u2019s autonomous life, Gamma felt fear. and it was the last thing she saw as she went tumbling down into the sweet, gaping maw of the Earth. Gamma was born into a 16-year-old-female-titanium skeleton within generation 3 ( even though Honeycakes remains to be ~10 years older than her), and is the second youngest clone in that generation outside of Epsilon. She was born prematurely, but is still quite healthy. She never particularly stood out when fighting for Pyrrhon, except until when she\u2019d left FUTURE. Everyone else kind of ignored the newer g3 clones, and many (like Phi, Chi, and Muse) didn\u2019t even know that they existed. Because of her general.. being-ignored-thing, she was paired up with another Low-level clone\u2014 a cranky old gen-2, half-working piece of scrap metal named Characters/Bosses/Prodigal|Prodigal. Over Gamma\u2019s lifetime (from years 8-17) she grew extremely close to Characters/Bosses/Prodigal|Prodigal, almost to the point of an obsession. Prodigal could have quite honestly cared less. Anyway, one day, Prodigal came up with a full map of FUTURE which had been dropped off of an abandoned hard-drive while she was dumpster diving. They began hatching a plan, a plan no one had thought of before: to get out of FUTURE once and for all. From 6 months of planning came the great escape from FUTURE. Their life, right in their hands, so close\u2014 As Gamma clung onto the hatch at the ceiling, Prodigal so close\u2014 BAM!! Gamma made it out alive. Prodigal did not. The last thing Gamma saw was the eyes of Pyrrhon, and nothing else, as she crashed into Earth\u2019s surface. For some odd reason, Gamma couldn\u2019t remember Prodigal\u2019s face when she landed. Nor Prodigal as a concept. Where was she? Gamma was saved by Constantine, a lone compsci nerd with nothing else to do but cut himself and weep. From that, she built her career of independent hitman work and bodyguarding and whatnot. There\u2019s something still that itches her though, and it\u2019s the strange, black, gooey figure who appears in the corner of her vision sometimes. Constantine was born into a little family in current-day Philipines, up in Bontoc. He lived in a small village, with very little access to technology except for things like fliphones and creaky computers. This is because it rains almost all the time, and most of the houses are made of tar, planks, leaves, metal sheets, etc. His parents never really let Constantine out of the house. It was against their religion to abort or abandon him, so they just locked him inside of the closet so he wouldn\u2019t rat them out. They got tax benefits, and played it off as, \u2018he\u2019s very sick\u2019. He was raised entirely online and by the internet, through chat rooms and such. He spent most of his time on (YouTube), scrolling on social media, involving himself in cheesy old forums, playing old games, etc. On one particularly bad night, Constantine was almost fatally injured by his father experimenting to make illegal drugs at home. He had walked in at bad times and ended up with awful chemical burns which left his face extremely disfigured and ugly. To cover them up, he wears a welding mask (he does actually know how to weld, since it\u2019s what he does for a living.) As he got older, he saw a few videos of people doing live surgeries on clones and other machines, and developed such a large hyperfixation for it, he\u2019d actually managed to write and create a master guide for clone, CORE, and Pi-Bot mechanics, due to his extensive research and abundance of time. This was a revolutionary thing, since it\u2019d never been compiled so easily for everyone. He also got a lot better at coding from this, and eventually got a few jobs (he\u2019d illegally gotten into a few databases for his master list). As Constantine grew older and more isolated, he built up his online reputation more and more. He works as a mechanic, but also as a blackmailer. his work partner is a girl named XETA, who has a huge crush on him but he\u2019s gay. She was the one who knocked some sense into him about the \u2018classic redditor views\u2019 he had. On another awful night of his, with his hands embedded with glass shards and tinted with blood, he walked out into his backyard with a gun, intending to end his life. He saw a star in the distant night. Small at first, but then grew into a hideously large explosion right next to him. As the dust settled, he\u2019d noticed a very small, delicate clone beneath him. His first instinct was to dissect her, which was exactly what he did. There is a full, well-documented website about this. He did it live while taking great care not to reveal himself (which he kind of did well). He extracted all of the software inside of Gamma since she was intact. It\u2019s rare since they\u2019re usually destroyed on impact by default. He sold the data to some people on the internet, then got quite a bit of money. After a few days of Gamma sitting there collecting dust, he decided to rebuild her (which wasn\u2019t documented for some reason) and save her. He didn\u2019t really know what to do with her, and mostly just sent her out to get him food from the outside. They eventually struck a deal which was essentially, Since you saved my life, I\u2019ll get you away from your parents, which Constantine accepted. From his fundings on the internet, he was sent to a school and got a license to be a mechanic/technician. Gamma left shortly after. Constantine is actually in horrific debt due to that (he vastly underestimated the cost and kind of got scammed) and is currently evading taxes and running a \u2018mechanic shop\u2019 (dark web/blackmail business) to keep himself alive for longer. Gamma\u2019s a merc, or a mercenary, who does paid work. Despite only being on Earth for such a short period of time, she\u2019s made quite the name for herself! But how..?! Gamma actually got her \u2018big break\u2019 by being scammed. Soon after she left Constantine\u2019s town, she went a bit money crazy and blew her money on dumb shit. just Kidding she wanted cybernetic implants\u2014 or at least, ones that wouldn\u2019t identify her as a clone so easily. She found one for an exceedingly good deal\u2014 a new charging port, which was almost seamless in her body. You could barely even tell it was there! It barely needed to be oiled and everything! And she didnt sleep on her side, so it\u2019s perfect! narrator: it was not perfect Gamma soon found herself in a tub of ice, completely naked, with her clothes torn up and weapons gone. She\u2019d been kidnapped! They weren\u2019t going to give her Cyberwear, they were going to take hers! Gamma doesn\u2019t remember much of the incident, or at least that\u2019s what she says. But Rita does. The first thing that Rita saw was a blood and gut covered ceiling, with weapons and scalpels turned everywhere, and a suspiciously naked little girl in the middle of it. She\u2019d killed all of the scavengers\u2014 and lived to tell the tale. admittedly, Rita\u2019s first thought was not \u2018is she okay\u2019 but \u2018wow i shoudl hire her!\u2019. And that\u2019s what she did. Gamma\u2019s been working peacefully with Rita, Moanama, and the other Fixers peacefully ever since.","title":"The Story So Far"},{"location":"Bits/Worldbuilding/CORE/","text":"A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There\u2019s a rumor that Pyrrhon injured God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it? It's something which wraps around your heart and becomes your heart. Your core is your physical strength. It eats away at your life energy and future strength to give you superhuman abilities now, with a very shortened lifespan. The longest national guardian to live was 43. A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action. Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN\u2019s whole lifetime can\u2019t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful. You level up your CORE using other\u2019s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth. You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE\u2019s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it. The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist. Unironically, Power Creep is a real issue in CORE. It\u2019s essentially: someone dies take their CORE Obtain a portion of their power that person dies take their CORE Obtain a portion of their power that person dies take their CORE Obtain a portion of their power And so on.","title":"CORE"},{"location":"Bits/Worldbuilding/Cloning/","text":"The Prodigal CORE Also known as The Mother Womb When God fell into Pyrrhon \u2019s hands, it was this incomprehensible green mass, which held no particular shape or form.

From greed came war, and from war came disease. Plants and Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body. The only things left were the Rumors which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures. They\u2019d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought. In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End. The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens. The rapture had begun. Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it\u2019s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped. As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton. The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God. It\u2019s the ultimate mothers womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it. There was a small girl inside of it. `Her name was Kei.` The last living ruler of Beau\u2019s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger. A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis. That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon\u2019s Golden Rule. She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch. Everything seemed fine. And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant. Everything has since been stuffed under the rug. With each disease cured, came millions of dead bodies. With each city liberated, came another pointless regulation. `Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug.` `To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too.` With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning. Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously young, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been. With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person. Pyrrhon. From her goal of reversing Beau\u2019s tyranny, she had become even worse. It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous \u2018clone army\u2019. This marked the years until now as \u201cThe Age of Eugenics\u201d, because that\u2019s what it was and still is. And everything\u2019s crumbling, all the same.

When Pyrrhon created her, she mutated. Pyrrhon was disgusted, and muttered, \u201cShe\u2019s mutilated.\u201d That became her name. Mutilation has an obsession with Pyrrhon as her motherly figure. Pyrrhon keeps her away, but Mutation knows almost all of her secrets because she\u2019s so nosy (including all of her clones and dirty secrets), so Pyrrhon is forced to spoil her. She\u2019s gained immortality and doesn\u2019t age. She steals body parts from soldiers she likes and places them inside of hers. Obviously some parts are already misplaced (the eye, mouth, etc were in that place at conception) so she has to put them there. She has Khan \u2019s leg and Chou \u2019s eye as of right now. She attempted to take Honeycakes (or as she knew him, OMEGA)\u2019s leg when Khan \u2019s got old and rotted, but they struck up a deal instead and OMEGA provided her with lots of other people for her to take instead of his. mutilation has an obsession with being a mother, which was by proxy of Pyrrhon when Nea was conceived. However her view of \u2018motherhood\u2019 is from Pyrrhon \u2014 not the best example. She witnessed everything Marian went through and was mostly just chewing her nails and watching excitedly, not understanding what was happening. She just understood that since Pyrrhon was doing it, it must mean that it was good. Her understanding of \u2018motherhood\u2019 is more \u2018abusive wife\u2019. She enjoys submissive men, specifically soldiers. She has boned with Honeycakes but Honeycakes remembers her as the freakiest, most sadistic bitch ever who was laughing uncontrollably the entire time and drooling everywhere and screaming and sobbing, so he isn\u2019t really interested in doing anything with her. Mutilation was created when Prodigal was, so Prodigal is quite old by affiliation. This was when Pyrrhon came into power FUN FACTS Herod makes noise by sloshing her organs around since he has no vocal chords Mutilation herself makes noise by complex technology. She commissioned an unknown scientist to have her vocal cords make noise through a radio instead of through a real mouth (since it\u2019s in her chest).

When Pyrrhon created her, she mutated. Pyrrhon was disgusted, and muttered, \u201cShe\u2019s mutilated.\u201d That became her name. Mutilation has an obsession with Pyrrhon as her motherly figure. Pyrrhon keeps her away, but Mutation knows almost all of her secrets because she\u2019s so nosy (including all of her clones and dirty secrets), so Pyrrhon is forced to spoil her. She\u2019s gained immortality and doesn\u2019t age. She steals body parts from soldiers she likes and places them inside of hers. Obviously some parts are already misplaced (the eye, mouth, etc were in that place at conception) so she has to put them there. She has Khan \u2019s leg and Chou \u2019s eye as of right now. She attempted to take Honeycakes (or as she knew him, OMEGA)\u2019s leg when Khan \u2019s got old and rotted, but they struck up a deal instead and OMEGA provided her with lots of other people for her to take instead of his. mutilation has an obsession with being a mother, which was by proxy of Pyrrhon when Nea was conceived. However her view of \u2018motherhood\u2019 is from Pyrrhon \u2014 not the best example. She witnessed everything Marian went through and was mostly just chewing her nails and watching excitedly, not understanding what was happening. She just understood that since Pyrrhon was doing it, it must mean that it was good. Her understanding of \u2018motherhood\u2019 is more \u2018abusive wife\u2019. She enjoys submissive men, specifically soldiers. She has boned with Honeycakes but Honeycakes remembers her as the freakiest, most sadistic bitch ever who was laughing uncontrollably the entire time and drooling everywhere and screaming and sobbing, so he isn\u2019t really interested in doing anything with her.

Clementine is sort of like a smiley.. Taiyo-ish.. strange and eccentric guy. He's self centered and works exclusively for himself. He doesnt even believe in the religion he's working for, he just does it for clout and benefits actually. Constantine doesn't agree with 90% of Clementines moral standings (which is ironic considering his line of work). Anyway, they do end up working together sometimes so people have theorized that they're in a relationship with each other.","title":"Clementine"},{"location":"Characters/NPCs/Functional%20NPCs/Constantine%20and%20Gamma/","text":"Gamma is prone to psychotic and manic episodes. She's canonically bipolar so a normal day for her and Constantine would go like this. Gamma nears the end of her euphoric high. Something ticks her off and she ends up spiraling into mania or psychosis She accepts every job available and kills everything she can, mostly at the cost of her own life. Her fixers alert Constantine , who passively throws food her way so she doesn't die. Gamma eats it up. She spends a few hours mutilating corpses (cutting them up, eating their organs, playing with them, (REDACTED)ing them, throwing them around, or playing with them like dolls). After a while she gets bored and fights until she drops. Constantine sedates her and takes her home at this time She usually beats him up and they fight Gamma : \"The version of myself you cling so dearly to is long dead and gone! I don't understand why you keep coming back?! Are you stupid? You love like a fucking DOG. I fucking hate you. I hate you so goddamn much. Are you fucking stupid? JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!!! I don't need your comfort-- I don't want your comfort you stupid fucking MUTT!! The ' Gamma ' you love so dearly is DEAD!!! DO YOU GET KT YET, YOU DUMB FUCK DOG? OR DO YOU NEED ME TO KICK YOUR CHEST IN FOR YOU TO GET IT?!! I HATE YOU!!!! I HATE YOU SO MUCH!! WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?! WHY WH--\" ( Gamma short circuits) Constantine , covered in blood and bruises shakily gets up and drags her back to his room, repairing her slowly through the night. Gamma remembers none of it again, but the crusts in her limbs are stained with dried blood. Constantine just stares down at her with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes Lips cut and cheeks burnt ... Constantine alters Gamma s memories CONSTANTLY. He feels guilty for it but \"it's for her own good\". Gamma doesn't know bc if she did she would probably kill him for real. so this night wouldn't happen in her ram. But it exists in long term. His reasoning for this heavily is based on \"If she remembers, she'll spiral (if she remembers, my creation leaves me).\" Gamma is very heavy on the self sustainable, non tampered version of clones. she despises memory and consciousness editing. Constantine does it half for his own safety but also half for himself. If Gamma fails, it's like. Gamma is his reason for living. He doesn't see her as a person, he sees her as his project and his pride and joy. \"She -she doesn't want to remember anyway! I'm the only one who can save her..\" he doesn\u2019t believe Gamma can handle herself without him. Which is true, but also ableist on his part. This isn't his call to make. Constantine is NOT a good person, I want to make this very very clear. None of the core characters are good people. Not at all. He adds fake memories of Gamma , so she pretends to have had a great childhood. To have has amazing friends, instead of face reality. Constantine can't break down and cry about it because that'll risk his identity. That's why he's so close to Shenx, because Shenx knows what he does to Gamma and it's the most powerful blackmail material out of ALL of them. It's why he's so obsessed to sucking shenx's dick in every aspect and why Shenx absolutely revels in it He isn\u2019t noble. He\u2019s not healthy. He\u2019s addicted to Gamma as a concept, to the ghost of the girl he thinks he saved, and to his own guilt and messiah complex. He takes hits like a dog because he doesn\u2019t believe he deserves anything better. And really, maybe he doesn\u2019t. He knows she\u2019ll tear him apart\u2014physically, mentally, spiritually\u2014but he doesn\u2019t care.

He took her, Khan , and Chou (his friend) with him to finish up the mission. The mission was to basically put down a rebellion/rebel group (it was TLH ...) Clementine Shenx. His parents were DEEPLY involved in TLH , and so was he. He was a fierce warrior even at like. Age ten. So of course he fought with them! Marian was kind of giving up (this is the night he left with Nea ) and Khan was super pissed off about it so he took his anger out on TLH . Khan saw Shenx and was in such a hurry to just slaughter everyone, he just sliced off Shenx's legs assuming he'd already died /would die of blood loss. Shenx did not die So his whole mission is fueled by revenge to kill Khan , and consequently Pyrrhon 's empire. He built his mech out of the remains of what was left in TLH and the dead clones that his parents killed. And went to the underground.. People generally respected this 12 year old boy walking in with no legs and a mech doing all sorts of crazy shit. He met lots of good friends (one in particular named Sho) and managed to scrape together enough money and people to revive TLH . It's an underground operation still, but they do operate. Tl;dr shenx is mad at Khan for cutting his legs off, revives a rebellion group out of spite Shenx actually discovered Marian and Khan again through Nea . I mean, Nea was Marian 's daughter that night. so he wasn't very pleased to find that out. He found out when he went to the hotel inn. They're all legally required to have a small pond for religious folk to meditate (treaty with nomads from a past war requires it). Shenx used it to take showers so when Nea showed up like to actually USE it to meditate he felt really bad. He tried to say \"oh this is how I meditate uh uh uh\" and she honestly couldn't give less of a shit. They started talking about religion and Nea just stared at him like, \"you're reallty bad at this\". Anyway the conversation lead to his missing legs, and he discovered taht she was Marian 's daughter. So she was almost stabbed that night if it weren't for Gamma . Nea agreed to bring Khan to TLH for Shenx in return for safety and a place to stay. This is a storyline that probably wont be canon, but I still have it. Khan is bound to a chair. Shenx just takes his unconscious body outside to the forest for a week. No one can find or contact him at all. No one knows where the hell he actually is or if he's ever coming back. Shenx kind of went on this.. psychotic breakdown on Khan ? Khan is actually still alive, but he was BADLY injured. Shenx said he wanted to fight him to the death to show him what he had learned since the last time they met. Khan said \"who the fuck are you? What's TLH ?\" So his lungs were pierced. Shenx is a bartender so he's like the therapist for everyone. so combine that with his own problems and issues, all bottled up... They fought so much that they died up in No Man's Land which is entirely out of Pyrrhon 's control. Shenx almost pierced his heart, but purposefully missed. He just bascially tortured Khan out in the forest and left him there. Khan is still alive, but just barely. He is still up and kicking even post game. Shenx just returns like nothing happened, but yk.. still shaken up about .. everything... He crashed at Constantine 's place first. He was covered in blood and crawling on the ground since his mech broke. He had the wide eyed bipolar schizophrenia look so Constantine surprisingly calmly took him in and treated him.

He flirts with \u2026 everyone really often, and enjoys watching them squirm. He\u2019s very easygoing, but is a bit mischievous. He tends to be selfish and will do things that benefit him first.

They, unlike Baluch and Nea , are on great terms. His full name is Coda#4 (Coda-Sharp-Four) Personality Coda is a hesitant, soft-spoken guy for such a great musician. He\u2019s charming and cool to the public, but in private, he mostly likes to be alone. He\u2019s not really struggling, but he isn\u2019t particularly famous either. Has a great moral code, but will do what he needs to do to survive. Coda isn\u2019t a great fighter, so he tends to avoid conflict. He can use magic (the conductors wand which he uses, which can also serve as a bow for his double bass if he so wishes) to launch soft projectiles. He just doesn\u2019t really like fighting, he has other things to worry about. Coda\u2019s kind of a wallflower. He sticks to himself and prioritizes himself. Of course, Nea does too, but she\u2019s a lot meaner about it. Family Coda comes from a distinct family of people. The family line goes something like this: (bassie, Altima, tena, mezzimo, and sorprania) (ionia) Unlike the rest of his family, he is not a part of the mafia. He instead enjoys rock and jazz, and conducts in his own little jazz band: Mixie (play on Mixolydio, his grandfather.) with Nea . Coda-sharp-four is his full name. This is because his family has already exhausted all music terms, so he could either be named sforzando b3 (Flat three) or Coda#4. The sharps are reserved for the men, while the flats are reserved for the women. Obviously the number will change based on how many times the name was used. While additions like these are for chords, they had to make do with it. There is a man in his family named Cmajb55. Relationship With Nea Nea played the Tenor sax, And Coda was their bassist (Electric and trad). Nea was the most advanced in music theory and was their best player. They\u2019d both had similar experiences with hating music in their childhood, so they got along quite well. Since Coda and Nea both enjoy music, they were extremely close, like brother and sister. Coda and Nea were kind of pressured to date each other by his family (and whatever was left of Nea\u2019s), so they did. They kissed a few times, but they weren\u2019t really romantically in love at all. They eventually broke up and decided to be friends. She still plays in Mixie, but much less frequently.

They\u2019re quite well off, though. Nea doesnt have much real resentment towards Coda. it was weird for her to not be shamed and beaten by whatever boyfriend she had at the time.

His above all special interest is studying Pyrrhon \u2019s COREs and learning about the past human civilization. Constantine is pretty cautiously offensive. Passive aggressive. Heavy restraint. He\u2019s generally timid and cautious, and extremely unathletic. kind of a NEET, a pathetic loser NEET. if if weren\u2019t for Gamma , he'd be executed via his student loans.

A loser, but a smart (and stubborn) loser. Oh, and Cassidy His outside disguise before TLH is as a mechanic. His personal workshop is a small stall wedged in-between two large buildings. He\u2019s really good but not well known. He mostly only works for himself and his friends. He\u2019s the main mechanic in TLH . He has scars from a bad burning accident while his dad was fucking with chemicals. He's physically fine. But he's so ugly he wears a welding mask to cover it up. Backstory Constantine was born into a little family in current-day Philipines, up in Bontoc. He lived in a small village, with very little access to technology except for things like fliphones and creaky computers. This is because it rains almost all the time, and most of the houses are made of tar, planks, leaves, metal sheets, etc. His parents never really let Constantine out of the house. It was against their religion to abort or abandon him, so they just locked him inside of the closet so he wouldn\u2019t rat them out. They got tax benefits, and played it off as, \u2018he\u2019s very sick\u2019. He was raised entirely online and by the internet, through chat rooms and such. He spent most of his time on (YouTube), scrolling on social media, involving himself in cheesy old forums, playing old games, etc. On one particularly bad night, Constantine was almost fatally injured by his father experimenting to make illegal drugs at home. He had walked in at bad times and ended up with awful chemical burns which left his face extremely disfigured and ugly. To cover them up, he wears a welding mask (he does actually know how to weld, since it\u2019s what he does for a living.) As he got older, he saw a few videos of people doing live surgeries on clones and other machines, and developed such a large hyperfixation for it, he\u2019d actually managed to write and create a master guide for clone, CORE, and Pi-Bot mechanics, due to his extensive research and abundance of time. This was a revolutionary thing, since it\u2019d never been compiled so easily for everyone. He also got a lot better at coding from this, and eventually got a few jobs (he\u2019d illegally gotten into a few databases for his master list). As Constantine grew older and more isolated, he built up his online reputation more and more. He works as a mechanic, but also as a blackmailer. his work partner is a girl named XETA, who has a huge crush on him but he\u2019s gay. She was the one who knocked some sense into him about the \u2018classic redditor views\u2019 he had. On another awful night of his, with his hands embedded with glass shards and tinted with blood, he walked out into his backyard with a gun, intending to end his life. He saw a star in the distant night. Small at first, but then grew into a hideously large explosion right next to him. As the dust settled, he\u2019d noticed a very small, delicate clone beneath him. His first instinct was to dissect her, which was exactly what he did. There is a full, well-documented website about this. He did it live while taking great care not to reveal himself (which he kind of did well). He extracted all of the software inside of Gamma since she was intact. It\u2019s rare since they\u2019re usually destroyed on impact by default. He sold the data to some people on the internet, then got quite a bit of money. After a few days of Gamma sitting there collecting dust, he decided to rebuild her (which wasn\u2019t documented for some reason) and save her. He didn\u2019t really know what to do with her, and mostly just sent her out to get him food from the outside. They eventually struck a deal which was essentially, Since you saved my life, I\u2019ll get you away from your parents, which Constantine accepted. From his fundings on the internet, he was sent to a school and got a license to be a mechanic/technician. Gamma left shortly after. Constantine is actually in horrific debt due to that (he vastly underestimated the cost and kind of got scammed) and is currently evading taxes and running a \u2018mechanic shop\u2019 (dark web/blackmail business) to keep himself alive for longer. Relationship with\u2026 Relationship with Shenx Constantine and Shenx have a pretty cooperative deal together. Constantine gives him information and Shenx provides him with basic needs. Shenx is essentially his boss and hires Constantine to get leads on gov officials. The rest of Shenx \u2019s team, like Sho , do all of the physical work. it took a very, very long time for Constantine to warm up to Shenx since he has pretty crippling anxiety, but it did happen and they\u2019re inseparable now. People speculate if they are dating. Constantine pretty vehemently denies it. Shenx doesn\u2019t seem to care. Relationship with XETA So people like to joke with Constantine saying that Xeta is his discord girlfriend. He likes to beat them back up. He's kind of scrawny so he just grumbles and leaves. He's a little gay twink (all compsci majors are). Xeta does actually really like Constantine but keeps her distance because she respects him. You can meet Xeta in game! Since she helps Const with work a lot. Xeta donated some money for him to rent a studio apartment where he currently runs his work. However, as Constantine took on more and more mercenary work, the less and less Xeta approved. It ended with a truce. But, not all truces last that long. Relationship with Clementine Next to him is a small church. One of the altar boys is named Clementine. He also deals with general dark-ish web deals, but not to the extent Constantine does. I think Constantine met Shenx when he was dealing with business. So he consequently met Clementine then. Clementine met Shenx and shortly joined TLH after because he had intel in the church he was in which is CRAZY powerful. So Clementine was there and Constantine and him didn't get along very well People like to call Clementine \"Constantine's evil twin\" because they're just complete opposites and bash each other's heads in constantly. Clementine is eh friends with Gamma. He's genuinely a huge piece of shit but they're civil to her. They work really well together, as a fighting duo. And with Clementine, they're all really good together. Shenx uses a mech, Clementine uses a weird spear thing, and Constantine uses his computer (he shields and supports his team). Shenx and Constantine's first major interaction was when they raided a huge party. They needed this piece of tech from a mansion and they both knew it was a suicide mission, but said \"eh fuck it. Nah, l'd win!\" So they dressed up together. Const actualy had to dress up as a girl in order to get in so Clementine really enjoyed blackmailing him with that. It's pretty heavily implied that Constantine and Shenx boned. Anyway Constantine just gets really shy around Shenx. People also theorize that about Shenx and Constantine Shenx is like the stereotypical bartender. thing? He's the guy with no legs if you remember him. He's just an overall sweet guy and Constantine really appreciates him. Actually so much that Constantine goes out of his way to give Shenx elaborate gifts as a thank you (shenx has started taking on Const's rent) Relationship with Gamma Constantine and Gamma have a pretty \u2018odd\u2019 relationship. While still civil, they aren\u2019t particularly close with each other. It\u2019s more of a business relationship\u2014 Constantine does what he wants with her, and she helps him financially. Or so it seems It gets A lot deeper than that though. Constantine and Gamma He\u2019s neutral about Nea . He is deeply scared of Honeycakes . Current Standings As of about right now, Constantine\u2019s job varies from blackmail, interceptions, hacking, etc. is Constantine a good person? No. Constantine dissected his now sister and sold her data to the dark web. Constantine actively ruins people\u2019s lives by selling their private information. Constantine blackmails people. But he is aware of that. He\u2019s aware he\u2019s irredeemable (is he?), and I think that\u2019s what makes him cool. I wouldn\u2019t say Constantine particularly enjoys being a part of the main story. He likes Shenx , and he likes Gamma . And he likes TLH , but he doesn\u2019t really like.. everything else. He doesn\u2019t want to be involved. Gameplay Signature Ability : Technician All items that Constantine uses get a boost to whatever their effect is (ie damage, debuff rate, healing percentage, buff duration, etc). At his final skill, Constantine is granted a 20% chance of \u2018revivability\u2019 Each time he uses an item. This basically means that whenever he uses an item, there\u2019s a 20% chance it will reactivate at 50% of its original power, which then makes it to be 150% + whatever his bonus is. If the 20% roll fails, gain a frustration meter. When frustration is at max, the next buff is guaranteed at 200%. Certain equipment can guarantee that 20% always fails OR is always guaranteed.) Extended Ability : Wormded Ability: WORM When pressing special attack while shooting, deploy a digital worm into an enemy\u2019s neural system. Enemies afflicted with WORM suffer -25% movement speed -25% attack speed +5% incoming damage (Note: The movement and attack speed debuffs do not stack.) If a WORM-afflicted enemy is killed or leaves the screen, the WORM transfers to the enemy with the highest ATK currently on-field. If multiple enemies share the highest ATK, it targets the nearest one to the dead enemy. If no valid enemies remain, the WORM returns to Constantine. WORMs last 15 seconds on a host. You may deploy a maximum of two. If both worms infect the same enemy, that enemy takes +15% extra damage, but ATK/MOV speed debuffs remain at -25%. Role : Long Range Heavy Hitter Did you know that Honeycakes is faster than this bastard? He wields a huge machine gun which weighs him down to the ground basically. Base : Snuffr Constantine has this huge rifle. The bullet will despawn once hitting the edge of the camera, essentially giving you range to hit whatever is in your view. He is kind of stationary, and can move and air-dodge while aiming, but it doesn\u2019t help.

His above all special interest is studying Pyrrhon \u2019s COREs and learning about the past human civilization. Constantine is pretty cautiously offensive. Passive aggressive. Heavy restraint. He\u2019s generally timid and cautious, and extremely unathletic. kind of a NEET, a pathetic loser NEET. if if weren\u2019t for Gamma , he'd be executed via his student loans.

He has scars from a bad burning accident while his dad was fucking with chemicals. He's physically fine. But he's so ugly he wears a welding mask to cover it up.","title":"Personality"},{"location":"Characters/Playable%20Characters/Constantine/#backstory","text":"Constantine was born into a little family in current-day Philipines, up in Bontoc. He lived in a small village, with very little access to technology except for things like fliphones and creaky computers. This is because it rains almost all the time, and most of the houses are made of tar, planks, leaves, metal sheets, etc. His parents never really let Constantine out of the house. It was against their religion to abort or abandon him, so they just locked him inside of the closet so he wouldn\u2019t rat them out. They got tax benefits, and played it off as, \u2018he\u2019s very sick\u2019. He was raised entirely online and by the internet, through chat rooms and such. He spent most of his time on (YouTube), scrolling on social media, involving himself in cheesy old forums, playing old games, etc. On one particularly bad night, Constantine was almost fatally injured by his father experimenting to make illegal drugs at home. He had walked in at bad times and ended up with awful chemical burns which left his face extremely disfigured and ugly. To cover them up, he wears a welding mask (he does actually know how to weld, since it\u2019s what he does for a living.) As he got older, he saw a few videos of people doing live surgeries on clones and other machines, and developed such a large hyperfixation for it, he\u2019d actually managed to write and create a master guide for clone, CORE, and Pi-Bot mechanics, due to his extensive research and abundance of time. This was a revolutionary thing, since it\u2019d never been compiled so easily for everyone. He also got a lot better at coding from this, and eventually got a few jobs (he\u2019d illegally gotten into a few databases for his master list). As Constantine grew older and more isolated, he built up his online reputation more and more. He works as a mechanic, but also as a blackmailer. his work partner is a girl named XETA, who has a huge crush on him but he\u2019s gay. She was the one who knocked some sense into him about the \u2018classic redditor views\u2019 he had. On another awful night of his, with his hands embedded with glass shards and tinted with blood, he walked out into his backyard with a gun, intending to end his life. He saw a star in the distant night. Small at first, but then grew into a hideously large explosion right next to him. As the dust settled, he\u2019d noticed a very small, delicate clone beneath him. His first instinct was to dissect her, which was exactly what he did. There is a full, well-documented website about this. He did it live while taking great care not to reveal himself (which he kind of did well). He extracted all of the software inside of Gamma since she was intact. It\u2019s rare since they\u2019re usually destroyed on impact by default. He sold the data to some people on the internet, then got quite a bit of money. After a few days of Gamma sitting there collecting dust, he decided to rebuild her (which wasn\u2019t documented for some reason) and save her. He didn\u2019t really know what to do with her, and mostly just sent her out to get him food from the outside. They eventually struck a deal which was essentially, Since you saved my life, I\u2019ll get you away from your parents, which Constantine accepted. From his fundings on the internet, he was sent to a school and got a license to be a mechanic/technician. Gamma left shortly after. Constantine is actually in horrific debt due to that (he vastly underestimated the cost and kind of got scammed) and is currently evading taxes and running a \u2018mechanic shop\u2019 (dark web/blackmail business) to keep himself alive for longer.","title":"Backstory"},{"location":"Characters/Playable%20Characters/Constantine/#relationship-with","text":"Relationship with Shenx Constantine and Shenx have a pretty cooperative deal together. Constantine gives him information and Shenx provides him with basic needs. Shenx is essentially his boss and hires Constantine to get leads on gov officials. The rest of Shenx \u2019s team, like Sho , do all of the physical work. it took a very, very long time for Constantine to warm up to Shenx since he has pretty crippling anxiety, but it did happen and they\u2019re inseparable now. People speculate if they are dating. Constantine pretty vehemently denies it. Shenx doesn\u2019t seem to care. Relationship with XETA So people like to joke with Constantine saying that Xeta is his discord girlfriend. He likes to beat them back up. He's kind of scrawny so he just grumbles and leaves. He's a little gay twink (all compsci majors are). Xeta does actually really like Constantine but keeps her distance because she respects him. You can meet Xeta in game! Since she helps Const with work a lot. Xeta donated some money for him to rent a studio apartment where he currently runs his work. However, as Constantine took on more and more mercenary work, the less and less Xeta approved. It ended with a truce. But, not all truces last that long. Relationship with Clementine Next to him is a small church. One of the altar boys is named Clementine. He also deals with general dark-ish web deals, but not to the extent Constantine does. I think Constantine met Shenx when he was dealing with business. So he consequently met Clementine then. Clementine met Shenx and shortly joined TLH after because he had intel in the church he was in which is CRAZY powerful. So Clementine was there and Constantine and him didn't get along very well People like to call Clementine \"Constantine's evil twin\" because they're just complete opposites and bash each other's heads in constantly. Clementine is eh friends with Gamma. He's genuinely a huge piece of shit but they're civil to her. They work really well together, as a fighting duo. And with Clementine, they're all really good together. Shenx uses a mech, Clementine uses a weird spear thing, and Constantine uses his computer (he shields and supports his team). Shenx and Constantine's first major interaction was when they raided a huge party. They needed this piece of tech from a mansion and they both knew it was a suicide mission, but said \"eh fuck it. Nah, l'd win!\" So they dressed up together. Const actualy had to dress up as a girl in order to get in so Clementine really enjoyed blackmailing him with that. It's pretty heavily implied that Constantine and Shenx boned. Anyway Constantine just gets really shy around Shenx. People also theorize that about Shenx and Constantine Shenx is like the stereotypical bartender. thing? He's the guy with no legs if you remember him. He's just an overall sweet guy and Constantine really appreciates him. Actually so much that Constantine goes out of his way to give Shenx elaborate gifts as a thank you (shenx has started taking on Const's rent) Relationship with Gamma Constantine and Gamma have a pretty \u2018odd\u2019 relationship. While still civil, they aren\u2019t particularly close with each other. It\u2019s more of a business relationship\u2014 Constantine does what he wants with her, and she helps him financially. Or so it seems It gets A lot deeper than that though. Constantine and Gamma He\u2019s neutral about Nea .

But he is aware of that. He\u2019s aware he\u2019s irredeemable (is he?), and I think that\u2019s what makes him cool.

Like many of my characters, she\u2019s a small expansion of me. You look at Honeycakes, and she\u2019s a bubbly and aggressive idiot. Like, really stupid. She takes jokes too seriously, or they fly over her head. She finds the stupidest, goriest things hilarious. She\u2019s upbeat and aloof and comfortable, without a single care in the world. No social awareness, just floating around above the rest. She sees herself as an older-sister type to others. Can be serious if she really does try hard enough. Can care about people if she really wants to.. well, actually, Honeycakes cares a lot about things, like her job as well as current world politics. She\u2019s extremely pessimistic and won\u2019t hesitate to tear you to shreds, should you get too close. She\u2019s aggressive to a psychotic fault, like a wild animal. Honey\u2019s surprisingly empathetic to other clones and is usually willing to give people a second chance, even the ones that she almost kills. She doesn\u2019t really know how to get her point across other than pure and raw violence. She doubles down and is stubborn and hard-headed. Backstory Honey doesn\u2019t have much to her, so she says. Born in 3.0\u2019s \u201chumanitarian cloning program\u201d, she was no 3 out of 9. The smaller the number, the older the body skeleton. Honey was born into the body of a 25-year-old male. He\u2019s Omega , he\u2019s the world\u2019s best clone. Honey had the most of the PRODIGAL CORE inserted into him, giving him insane amounts of strength. With this, he was easily trusted and let into areas she shouldn\u2019t be. There\u2019s a reason why they try to dampen the intellect of clones nowadays. Honey looks around, and sees nothing but a world of everything he\u2019s ever hated. And he\u2019s sick of it . One small fight into a small rebellion, now he\u2019s chained up to the wall and tortured until she can barely breathe. Three days until execution. Honey has one last look at her original form, her mother core. Two days until execution. Honey begins to ponder. One day until execution. Then, nothing at all. No one, at least in the general public, knows what happened or where she went; All they know was that 3 PiBots were torn apart and that Pyrrhon \u2014 The original war leader Pyrrhon\u2014 was injured. Pyrrhon said she wanted to be there when \" Omega 's futile resistance fell\", and stood right in front of Honey taunting her. But Honey broke out and injured her. The laser was fired and Omega was nowhere to be found and is presumed dead. No one had ever done that before. And Honey\u2026 She\u2019s not Omega, she\u2019s not a clone, and she\u2019s not a 25-year-old-male skeleton. She\u2019s always felt comfortable as a girl, anyway. It's so hard to function I feel like my body has died with my soul trapped inside This cold death rattle in my chest feels just like pennies in a tin can Sugar, I wonder how long you will wait for me Or if you even thought to save the pieces of my shattered ego These terrible chemical vapors are cutting up my lungs She spent two years in the mountains, meditating and dealing with various underground facilities and organizations. With Kit, Dinh, Adam, and a few others. Her skin changed color. She started to become Honey . However, due to an unfortunate argument between Python and Honeycakes, they both parted ways, mostly on Honey\u2019s fault. It has been 5 and a half years since that day. She\u2019s got a job and a small group of friends and no history to her whatsoever. Now, Honey lives as a fisherman and chef, staying late nights at a restaurant preparing raw meats and salads. What a shame, for who else to show up at her front door, 5 years later, but the woman she almost killed? Relationships with... Misc JUSTICE Honey\u2019s trusty hammer! Heavy enough that almost no one can pick it up, except Honey. She picks it up with ease, one-handed, while it takes Gamma, Nea, and Constantine to even lift it up 3 inches. Coated with leather and made with beryllium, it\u2019s painted with brass and red, despite being diamond on the inside. On each end, one fire, one electric. Two fuel tanks, made of the two chemicals in bombdeber (?? ) beetles, so it can activate almost immediately. Sometimes she burns herself, so she has leather gloves. It\u2019s personalized with small star stickers and cute ribbons. It has spikes on the rims. There\u2019s not much to Justice, other that Honey stole it from an old man, found dead in his home. She paid her respects and everything, but that hammer was pretty sick. Wonder who that guy was.. Beryllium has a very high heat capacity, so it can catch fire for a long time. She's good at preparing raw meat but ASS at cooking, so she's mostly hired to do preparations at the restaurant. She\u2019s a great swimmer! She loves fish and she loves to eat them. She\u2019ll prepare any meal for you! She likes dressing up fancy and she is really fucking hot in makeup, idfk why she's insanely good at it despite never attending a formal event. She exclusively eats meat, and nothing else. Which is funny, because her girlfriend is strictly vegetarian. Her favorite is raw fish. She likes pine trees and drinking sap. Her favorite holiday is St. Patrick's for no real reason, other than she thinks that the entire concept of \u201cleprechauns\u201d and \u201cIrish people\u201d is the most amusing thing in the world. Her favorite fruit is Jujube and she enjoys banana flavored snacks. She really hates Christmas. Really, really hates Christmas\u2014 almost as much as she hates insects! Did I mention she has a deathly fear of insects? Honey really likes classical music and really hates techno of any kind. She likes jazz and can play trombone. I like to imagine that some independent fishers go out paddle boarding to save on power and electricity. Also because they cant afford boats. Honey does this with a lot of her days, but a lot of the fishing areas are mostly filled with oil.. luckily for her, that means the fish float near the surface so she\u2019s able to stab them. Shes a great paddler, she just doesnt like water bc she weighs like 2 tons (kidding). I also like to headcanon that honey is so heavy, that when she sits down on a chair, she doesnt actually sit down or she\u2019d break it. She does an electric chair squat instead. me and Chasmus\u2019 creator don\u2019t talk anymore. So I\u2019m looking to replace Chasmus.. Honey and Chasmus - Honey works alone in the CORE equivalent of Baguio (I HEART BAGUIO!!!!!!). She works with a street chef. She goes out to get materials because of her unmatched strength.

She\u2019s kind of miserable,, her boss treats her badly,,, but also, she\u2019s a clone and clones have extremely bad reputation in that area. Due to construction and lack of funding she can\u2019t get out, so she\u2019s stuck there. Chasmus goes to her stand to buy some materials.

Age 18 was the day to take over her father. She doesn\u2019t really like her father. Cold and stoic and harsh, that\u2019s all. No loving relationship whatsoever, barely even a father. And God knows what sort of mother she might\u2019ve had should she had lived. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201dI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian , renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. Five years later, no one knows it was her. Not that many people knew that temples still existed, anyway. Much less that one burned down in the middle of nowhere. She attends schools and colleges, since what else could you do? But slave away her magic for a machine which rejected the very idea of her? Nea only bites her teeth and steels herself. No point in fighting a losing battle. That is, until a little clone named Gamma stole something particularly important to her. Relationship with... Marian She despises him. She believes him to be the root cause of every single one of her issues. And she isn\u2019t very wrong about that. When Nea was four years old, Marian met her for the first time. He had such an immense breakdown, he almost killed Nea at the altar and sacrificed her. He was stopped by the temple guards. When Nea was six years old, Marian began to teach her how to sword fight. it entailed lots and lots of physical violence between them both. At sixteen, Baluch (). Marian walked in right as Baluch did it and thrwe Baluch Out by the scruff of his neck. He handed Nea some clothes without a word and instructed her to get changed. Baluch ended up with such horrific wounds he was permanently paralyzed from the legs down. Marian was not kicked out, but he was severely demoted. i mean, they really hated each other. Marian saw her as an embodiment of Pyrrhon that he couldn\u2019t escape. Nea saw him as an insufferable wife beater. They have had three civil conversations. One when she met Khan, one when Baluch assaulted her, and one at his suicide. She doesn\u2019t understand him and frankly she isn\u2019t very interested to do so. Gamma Gamma is an anomaly to her. Simultaneously the most human non-human she\u2019s ever met. A weird amalgamation of morals mixed with bloodshed. Initially she was drawn to Gamma because of her odd morality, like an object to study. Also, because she didn\u2019t have much of a choice at the time. But Gamma just intrigues her. And engineers are known for their undying curiosity Constantine She has nothing to say about him. Honeycakes A strained older-sister type relationship. Shenx Shenx temporarily grew up in the same religious sect as she did, so they bond over that. Shenx is a bit bad with religious customs, but Nea helps him out. She\u2019s also a great information broker for him, so he enjoys having her. She\u2019s also a backup for Gamma Shou Shou respects Nea because Nea\u2019s the only one to both leave her alone and put up with her bullshit. She doesnt like Nea, but she tolerates her. Which is a lot better than most Khan She hates him more Than anything. As the next embodiment of her father, he\u2019s the one to stake the blame in his place. Rhaika-Lei She thinks he\u2019s a stuck up pompous bastard who deserves nothing that he\u2019s \u201cachieved\u201d. MISC The Malleable Object. All that\u2019s left of her father\u2019s CORE is his hopes in dreams: in liquid form! It\u2019s pink and glittery and shines dimly at normal levels. It\u2019s malleable, which means she can form it into any object: but the more deadly the object, the more energy it takes for her to form it. She typically uses it as a shield. It is mainly used as a transportation device. She tends to sprint for short distances, but gets tired and ends up running the rest of the way. Imagine it like a hoverboard. The malleable object can break, but it will repair over time. When it does, however, it takes a very long time to heal, and Nea is basically helpless. She yells to Gamma or Honeycakes for help, since she can\u2019t do much. The Malleable object can only form into things that Nea knows the ins and outs of from memory. Basically construction from memory. it can go into musical instruments, but she must provide the reed. Nea likes grapes and grape-flavored items. She likes graphing calculators a lot, she really wants one but has never bought one. Nea likes sparkling drinks of any time, especially spiked ones, but she\u2019ll only drink it if it contains sugar of some kind She prefers suits over dresses. She really likes chocolate-flavored items, especially cakes. Despite her mainly playing her viola, she plays other instruments. Her other favorites include the oboe, double bass, and piano. She is practicing alto saxophone right now. Nea likes hardstyle techno, and phantom of the opera She and Balach were in a situationship a while back, so they\u2019re particularly bitter against each other. He overstepped her boundaries, but ONCE. Marian walked in and beat the living shit out of Balach. He took Nea out of the temple and sent her to school. It was the only time she saw him cry, even at his death. her birthday is November 13th. The rapture was Nov 10. She\u2019s not the biggest fan. Childhood Nea as a child,, She\u2019s like, Really self-centered and quite manipulative, she used her looks and good reputation to gain attention from people around her to give her stuff. She bought a lot of stupid items. She was particularly good at love bombing and gaslighting She was okay at school, for a time. She had a small phase where she rebelled (they had the money to just stop..) and dropped out of school for a while to do random shit, like sports. But her dad forced her back in. Even as a kid, she was really loud. She didn\u2019t cry but she wailed, and she wailed a lot. She was a stubborn little brat who always wanted her way. Quite literally no empathy for other people, she was one of THOSE popular kids. Nea was taken out of her last two years of middle school to do intensive temple training, which actually brought her back into shape and she became a little less spoiled. She became good at fighting and was now really educated in religion and everything because she literally worked her ASS off (out of complete spite, there was another girl she didn\u2019t like in her program). Her dad congratulated her, which gave her the confidence to start trying in school. In high school, she was like twilight sparkle but more sociable. She was \u201cpopular\u201d, but mostly because the popular kids there liked her because she\u2019d let them cheat off her homework. She went to the same school Chasmus went to, fun fact. Anyway, she ended up getting a boyfriend. She thought that she could easily take advantage of his new money for her own advantage, but no! Nea actually got uh, into a very bad and toxic relationship! I mean, sure, she had \u201crelationships\u201d but none of those guys could really \u201chandle her\u201d (poor and she was really energetic and got too excited a lot). He kinda, like, used her for her body and turned all of her previous manipulation tactics against her, so she was in a terrible state until she was taken out AGAIN for more religious training, which she was pretty happy to do. So for three years, she didn\u2019t step foot outside of her temple. She was in a pretty nasty mental state, and it\u2019s not like her dad really helped her with that. Marian doesn\u2019t know how to deal with kids so he\u2019s kinda emotionally neglectful and lashes out at them a lot. He\u2019s actually a little abusive, so Nea had a bad relationship with him. He also hated her because of what happened with Pyrrhon, but he was getting better slowly and was now (badly) trying to spark a relationship with her. However she rejected 99% of attempts (except one, which was near the end). So she mastered the art of Refined Magic, good job, Nea! By this time, she\u2019d graduated high school solely off of religious exemption and now worked at her temple for one more year, until Pyrrhon invaded it, and then she burned the temple down,, Mostly because she had almost never suffered the consequences of her own actions before. Anything broken could always be replaced with her money, but her father is gone, and years of history is now ash, and Pyrrhon\u2019s after her, and she\u2019s completely useless now. She never talked about her religious background, but bought herself a fake identity after working a year or so in the underworld. She went to school for engineering and minored in music while working her side job in the underworld, But like, she got fired.. and like, she met Gamma.. and like, got kicked out of school because she\u2019s rumored to be dead.. After Marian\u2019s death she became really quiet and completely reconstructed herself as a being. She\u2019s also really NARCISITIC STILL HONESTLY FUCKING LEARN!!! But she leans on the independent, \u201cI\u2019m better than you and you will taint me by your presence!\u201d Playstyle Role: Classic all rounder, self-sustainer While she has a pretty heavy lean into magic attacks, she\u2019s quite slow compared to others. She\u2019s a mid-ranged attacker who can dish out all kinds of attacks and heal herself. She\u2019s more of a jack of all trades (with a heavy lean into her special attacks). Signature Ability : RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE Each combo hit above 5 will add an increased +1% damage to the next hit. this stacks on top of other bonuses ie 6 hit: 101% dmg 7 hits: 102% dmg (+2% of it's normal damage) 8 hits: 103% dmg ... etc. This value resets once the combo ends Extended Ability: Counterpoint! If Nea is hit mid-swing by a PHYSICAL attack, then trigger a parry slash. Also, gain the ability to cancel an enemy attack once every 5 seconds. Base : Swords Dance Exactly what it sounds like! Nea does two quick slashes then a down swing. Shift : Grace Notes All melee attacks gain +1 phantom hit at 50% damage (visually distinct, hits slightly after the main strike) These phantom hits count toward combo count and RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE bonus. All phantom hits deal magic damage. Parrying during Grace Notes automatically resets the cooldown of your next combo finisher, letting you loop offense faster. HOWEVER Nea will eventually get bored and tired of this, so SHIFT can only last for about 12 seconds before she goes back. 20 second cooldown between each. ULTIMATE : ()) aaaa \u201dpatch notes\u201d: Old ultimate: Passive regen for all teammates for the duration of her ult. ULT - Martyr (if neutral is pressed). Heals 25-75% of Nea\u2019s missing HP to her teammates, but not her. She also provides shields for each new teammate which tags in, but weaker that Constantine. ULT - Blood Drive (if special is pressed) Every single attack deals like +3 hits of splash damage for a few seconds. Works particularly well with her CHAINING ability. ULT- Rhaika-Lei reveals his third eye, which shoots two dragons out of his soul to attack all of the enemies within his line of sight in a straight line. It will freeze them and temporarily interrupt almost all attacks, except for those immune to interruptions. Applies the \u2018inked\u2019 debuff to the enemies, which essentially grants more damage dealt to them, the more that they are hit with the ink. Destroying the enemy will replenish all of the ink, and can be thrown again to the next enemy. Ability : RHYTHMIC DISSONANCE Each combo hit above 5 will add an increased +1% damage to the next hit. this stacks on top of other bonuses ie 6 hit: 101% dmg 7 hits: 102% dmg (+2% of it's normal damage) 8 hits: 103% dmg ... etc. This value resets once the combo ends Base : Swords Dance Exactly what it sounds like! Nea does two quick slashes then a down swing. Shift : VOID AFINITY By sacrificing 10% of Nea's Max Health She will summon a small 'void'. Each 'void' will add one additional combo hit to each new combo. All damage caused by the 'voids' are considered as magic damage. Basically A normal combo is 4 hits for Nea +1 void = 5 hits +2 voids = 6 hits +3 voids = 7 hits +4 voids = 9 hits It caps out at 4 voids (-40% max health) Additionally, when removing a void, restore 5% max health AND recover 5% of all damage caused .

A former battlefield for Pyrrhon now turned into the coldest country. Similarly to current day Russia, most Sosolensk denizens are portrayed as cold, strong, and incredibly intimidating. It\u2019s up in the snowy mountains, up in the center. It\u2019s much flatter and more prosperous than H\u00e0-Binh , known for its rich architecture and strict culture. Living conditions aren\u2019t as awful as Ngima but, they\u2019re not too great either (depending on where you go). Sosolensk is sort of like Hawaii, the hot stop vacation for white girls pretending to be adventurous. Larger areas like Pyatinsty and Shaskala are much more inhabitable, but there are cities and people who live deep in the mountains hunting frozen meat. Pyatintsy The ice palace The place of rumors! Somewhere deep in the less populated areas of Sosolensk, mostly of for tribal people and extreme explorers. A gorgeous place, if you do have the balls to explore it. Many monks go there for their final test of religious training. There\u2019s little to no technology, frozen rivers and almost no warmth. Many people do, in fact, die here. You\u2019ve seen those ice bars and those buildings made of ice? That\u2019s Pyatintsy. People do permanently live here, but very little of them do. They typically eat raw meats and fend for themselves. Tribal infighting is rare here, despite the four tribes which do live there. Astanrog Fortress of God Far away from Pyatintsy, a mountainous region with tunnels inside of it. This, however, is the headquarters of all monks and religious folk. Shaskala Corpo Palace Bylesk Home of the monks. this is where Khan had originally lived, a large mausoleum/monestary for monks and other religious figures. The whole monestary is dug deep into the mountains, a large connection of various tunnels. The whole interior of the mountain is inhabitable, almost like its own city. One of the wonrders of the world, since most of it is built with wood and little technology. Currently fighting with Pyatintsy politically. While people often go to Bylesk as their secondary vacation spot, most of the inhabitants are very secretive and absolutely hate tourists.

You also crushed her head in, so.. just take her CORE. You are given a perma core and instructed to go out to the forest. at this time, you can explore more of the caves. This is the first area, congrats! The city is closed off because there are guards looking for a \u2018runaway worker\u2019. Wonder who that is! It is also the afternoon, and things will be different in the nighttime. They tell you to defeat enemies (plants) to be able to survive the night. It\u2019s nighttime. A lever opens for a room near the entrance. When you enter, You see a blue Stickfig who appeared behind you. This is Gamma! She tosses her cig on the ground and activates her weapons. Insert dialogue here. Secondary boss, that you\u2019re healed from! So this is where you\u2019re introduced to physical damage and magic damage. While Nea is much weaker to physical damage, Gamma is weak to magic damage. If only you could get a special move in\u2026 Gamma\u2019s pride is hurt when you \u2018defeat her\u2019, so she just leaves. There is a waterfall in the next room over. You can rest there. There is also a fridge where you can save LMFAO dont ask me why its there. The city is still being guarded so you have no choice but to find the NPC which gives you a small map, and defeat more enemies because its absurdly expensive. (Joke) You also don\u2019t have to, you can also just go to the end of the map, where you spot Prodigal from a distance. You follow him. From there, you see Gamma. She\u2019s laying on the ground with a power bank in her hands. You can pick it up, and also pick her up too. When you take it, something rumbles in the distance. a bomb is thrown\u2014 PRODIGAL!! Gamma shoots up. She suddenly collapses onto Nea. You \u2018put her into your inventory\u2019 LMFAOOGAHEHA You run with Gamma out the forest (it\u2019s just your normal sprite) and into the next area, where you flick a lever to stop her. shift to a small campfire that Gamma made. They talk for a bit. \u201cOh.. so you\u2019re from the temples? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d Gamma joins your party . Also, the city is open again. You can go there when youre done exploring. Upon entering the city\u2026 CTSCNE She spots a guy on the street. G \u201cNea, launch me.\u201d N \u201cWh-what?!\u201d G \u201dNEA, LAUNCH ME!\u201d Nea launches her towards that guy. She tackles him to the ground. Nea\u2019s about to sob her eyes out, but oh! That\u2019s actually her little brother, Constantine. G \u201cyou little fucker! What\u2019re you doin here?!?! Heheh!! C \u201cGa-Gamma..!\u201d C \u201cWhat the fuck?! I thought you were Prodigal!!\u201d G \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you moved here!! How\u2019re ya doin, Const?\u201d C \u201cTerrible, now that you\u2019re here.\u201d G \u201cVery funny Constantine. So, you\u2019re still the engineer, right?\u201d C \u201cUh oh, what is it this time?\u201d Gamma holds the CORE up to Constantine. Nea finally catches up to them, gasping for air. Constantine\u2019s eyes light up. C \u201cI have an extra room.\u201d Constantine is like, \u201cyeah one of you can take this CORE; it\u2019ll power yours up and give you a temporary buff. I think Gamma doesn\u2019t deserve it, so why don\u2019t you take it, Nea?\u201d (Gamma starts beating him up /j). He says you can pay him back later with the Danari you collect from enemies. Starting guide: I want There\u2019s this gang of animal-like people. They\u2019re actually trying to revive a dead religion and all believe that they are one with the spirits of their warrior ancestors. They are not. Gamma and Nea seek freedom To disrupt Pyrrhon\u2019s control, which seems impossible. MAYBE go back to the video game plot; the one where Pyrrhon is self aware They will do this by constructing the ULTIMATE CORE! Using theft Trading/bartering At first: nea is fired whatergver Brawl with Gamma \u201cFuck you!\u201d \u201cFuck you!\u201d Get lost in forest. \u201cOh it\u2019s you\u201d. Gamma and Nea meet from a peace treaty. Instead of Prodigal, they are initially followed by Commander Vee. He wants to kill both of them simply to raise his hierarchal status. \u201cWhat luck, that I\u2019d find two beautiful girls, all trapped in here like this! Come now!\u201d Nea: this guy got me fired! Gamma: this guy got me fired! They run away and he\u2019s really mad so he chases them around. Now: Run around to get information and more gear Ok so they hide under the bar tables when Vee shows up to the slaughterhouse. They see how he threatens Shenx and brags about how he can leave this useless slum anytime he wants, and he has a home up there in the heavens. It\u2019s fact checked by Gamma\u2014 he does! They now want to kill him to get that. However they have no fuckin idea where he is. This guy\u2019s all bark no bite.. if we can get ahold of his stuff, we\u2019d be rich beyond belief! We gotta kill this guy! \u201cYou might wanna talk to your brother, Gamma.\u201d \u201cH-huh?! How\u2019d you\u2014?!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve (shnx and const) been friends for decades. \u2018Course I know who you are.\u201d Nea: (Maybe this girl is useful. Hah). Constantine is over in (Baguio!) Cue them being productive and encountering a few sidequests: Eskalion\u2019s attack patterns ATK one: Starts from one side of the stage, and runs at you at blinding speeds. It\u2019ll damage you if you\u2019re in the middle of it. He teleports and reappears above you and does one of two things A) he will shoot DIRECTLY BELOW HIM B) he will shoot to both corners of the room. Then he will disappear and reappear either grabbing at the walls or on the ground, preparing to fight again. If he\u2019s on the wall, he will shoot in your general direction four times, teleport behind you, (he will linger so you can counter or move away), and swing. The swing is really big, but so is his cooldown. If he\u2019s on the ground, he can: shoot at you with his gun jump up (From jumping up, he can either guard and reflect all bullets back at the player, OR he can throw a bomb. It basically goes in a straight line and can go as far as like, 25% of the room. So from the starting point (when he throws it) and when it ends, it bounces three times. Then, it\u2019ll explode into large pillars which reach to the top of the room). lunge again At 25% health, he\u2019ll crawl up to the top of the room, and swing around on a chandelier. He will shoot at you hysterically and you can\u2019t deal any damage, so you just have to avoid it or guard. After that, he\u2019s in a ravenous state and has increased speed, but lowered defense. His atk is much much higher thoughSo after this you probably get an introduction to Constantine and CORE buffs. End Once he dies, I\u2019ll initiate Prodigal/Balach\u2019s arc, HORRAY! So upon death, he crawls over to the wall, while Gamma puts a gun in his head. He starts rambling incoherently about \u201cGod\u2019s divine Will\u201d, \u201crevenge\u201d, \u201cthe Goddess\u201d, and other nonsensical religious bullshit. He then lets out a final plea of himself being a prophet or whatever, general religious psychosis talk. Then, he reaches out to the wall, and presses a big red button (which was once enclosed in a glass container). After that, the windows all shatter, and Prodigal jumps in. Vee starts talking to her and asks if she\u2019s proud of him, but she just shoots him. Gamma and Nea are frozen in fear. Prodigal ignores them, and throws his limp body across the room, like a child playing with a toy. She then rips his head off and plays with his entrails. Yay! The screen blacks out and Prodigal is gone, Gamma and Nea both passed out. All that\u2019s left is black goop and Vee\u2019s gun, which you can take and use. Now, Gamma and Nea were trying to kill Vee so that they could get his ID shard, fake his identity, and rob him and the other corpos + get into restricted areas. However Prodigal broke it. Lmfao. Anyway the cops start to show up, so a cutscene plays where they just run out of the building.That\u2019s the end of the chapter. So there\u2019s a huge explosion and Gamma and Nea are blown away. They both wake up seeing Honey, but they dont know who she is. She drops them on the ground, flicks over a business card, then leaves. Cut to the Baguio place festival. Gamma is looking. ok basically if you go to Prodigal, you go to the Akira collesum It\u2019s basically dogtown. \u201cRumor has it, it\u2019s completely outta Pyrrhon\u2019s control. Being in No Man\u2019s Land, an\u2019 everything\u2026 bet ya haven\u2019t heard of it, huh? Let me show ya \u2018round.\u201d \u201dexcuse you! Everyone knows about this place.\u201d \u201cYeah.. I\u2019ve only heard rumors.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s.. oddly quiet.\u201d \u201dYeah, no merchants jumping out, huh? Hah. Guess if yer here, you\u2019re here coz ya know what you want. They don\u2019t need to sell you nothin\u2019. They got corpos an\u2019 war criminals, all in one place.\u201d \u201dHuh..\u201d \u201dHeard you could get up to the space station if you had enough money.. well, you can get anything if you have enough money.\u201d (Cue guy selling organs) \u201d\u2026 uh huh. So, who are we lookin\u2019 for, again?\u201d (Point). PREDEM II FINAL DUNGEON The lives we\u2019ve left behind And whatever God is left for us. \u201cThe factory\u2019s been abandoned for some time now. But it started pumping out materials again!\u201d \u201cHuh? What is the factory? Well, it was from the RAPTURE, it\u2019s got some of Pyrrhon\u2019s old radiators. If someone tries hard enough, they could make a bomb, but\u2014..\u201d \u201cH-hey!! Where are you two rascals going?!\u201d \u201cThis is it,\u201d Says Nea. \u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d Says Gamma. Get in the side scroller mode for a period of time and hijack a ship entering from the factory. Fight through it with the terrain changing due to the changes in altitude. You play as Gamma first when they agree to split up. You go through a large wave of enemies and hit the button to stop the power flow, but the ship still goes. It\u2019s up to Nea. Cutscene of Nea running along the side of the ship and into Balach\u2019s chamber. Follow him through a third wave in the storage cavity. \u201cHAHAHAH\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re pathetic, Nea!\u201d \u201cJust try to find me!\u201d you can\u2019t actually find him. Break through the door and walk through it, and get pinned to the ground by Balach. \u201cHah..!\u201d each line of dialogue takes off like, 10% of your remaining HP. \u201cLook at you! Pathetic!\u201d \u201cYOU took EVERYTHING from me!\u201d \u201cHahhah.. hahah .. look at you,\u201d \u201cWEAK!! YOU\u2019RE WEAK, NEA!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you are. A fuckin mindless puppet of your father.\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE HIDEOUS!\u201d Balach kicks her. Nea\u2019s HP falls to 0. \u201cHah..\u201d \u201cFutile, as always.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my end goal with you.\u201d Balach flicks a switch which turns on a screen on top of every single school, temple, and family. \u201cYou see, Nea?\u201d \u201cHahah. You didn\u2019t even know.\u201d \u201cNow, your CORE\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one powerful enough besides myself.\u201d \u201cHeheh..\u201d \u201cWait here, whore .\u201d Balach leaves. Nea rolls over and regenerates one HP. He walks in and nudges her with his foot. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re still awake?\u201d \u201cI should\u2019ve killed you, all those years ago.\u201d \u201cYou and your father.\u201d \u201cHah.\u201d \u201cRemember that day? You remember it well.\u201d \u201cI did plan on Pyrrhon. What I didn\u2019t plan on was his suicide. And you .\u201d \u201cThat CORE,\u201d He grabs Nea\u2019s chest. \u201cThat CORE is mine .\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cGive it up, Nea. Give it to me.\u201d Nea limply falls, but says one thing: \u201c\u2026 You killed him?\u201d Balach doesn\u2019t listen and takes out a knife. Nea grabs it. \u201cDad..\u201d \u201c...\u201d \u201cMy dad...\u201d Congrats to you and Nea for unlocking her secondary ULT!!~ ULT: BLOOD DRIVE is now active! Nea gathers all the blood seeped into the floor and revives herself with it. Whether enemy or stick, it\u2019s hers now. She fights Balach again, who\u2019s basically a dummy. He goes through the same cycle but you just deal infinitely more damage than he does. You chase after him and break all his shields until you pummel him into the ground, like the real ground, since youre in the sky. The dust settles. He\u2019s nothing but a CORE. Nea looks around. She\u2019s right next to a body of water, and a mysteriously burnt pillar. A nearby old and wet paper drifts in the wind. Versailles.. Nea crushes Balach\u2019s CORE, And falls asleep. Gamma falls to the ground in a nearby parachute, picks Nea up, and walks home. End of act one. From Now on Our primary goals after chapter One is character development and slower plot progression. CHARA GOAL: Focus on Gamma or Nea or Honey or Python Choice, can be done in any order. DRIVING FORCE End goal: stop Pyrrhon. Short term: Grow Stronger get PB CORE\u2019s for story progression. Stars EQ \u201cThere are five total maj chords we need in order to weaken Pyrrhon and nullify her core output. They\u2019re here.\u201d After all that, they get the goal and have one final life-changing event, then leads into the finale. Act 2: The Arena. I had a thought.. Now, CORE has a cool mechanic where you do not kill a single enemy. You knock them out. They will infinitely respawn once you take too long and until you reach the next area. You don\u2019t have to kill them, but you will get more rewards from the more you do. \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 is a rule Nea and Gamma stand by, since they\u2019re mostly fighting clones and Nea is obligated from religion. It goes something like this. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since Balach\u2019s death and Nea\u2019s evolution. She\u2019s still recovering from the magic overload. She\u2019s fine, I guess. Since we\u2019re alone, I\u2019ll tell ya, I\u2019m kinda jealous. I wish I could be as good as her. I wish I was useful. Goddamnit, look at the time! My food\u2019s ready! See ya later!\u201c CTSCNE Honeycakes swings a fish onto the table and begins to skin it. Chasmus takes the chopped pieces from earlier and pours it into a pot. Han takes a finished plate and carries it out. From above, Prodigal and Lane snicker. Prodigal reaches down to take the plate. Han looks around, confused. Chasmus looks angry and Han looks back, sheepishly. Prodigal hands the kebab to Lane, who eats it happily and giggles. They kick their feet off the roof and gaze off into the sky. Camera shifts and fades into the upper left. Khan is sharpening his sword from atop a mountain. Python is starting a nearby fire out of old parts and notices the town. The fireworks explode. Gamma and Nea walk through the town. \u201cHeheh! I told ya!\u201d \u201cWhatever, sure! Heh. Ow!!\u201d \u201cOops, sorry. I had this idea\u2026 Honey and Gamma become friends, almost immediately. It\u2019s quick, like a gust of wind. They talk, inside the restaurant. It\u2019s a dog eat dog world out there, they both know. Gamma says, \u201cDude, if I were rich, I\u2019d go up into the stars.. You know, the interplanetary cities? We can live it up there. Hah! \u2018s impossible though, we\u2019re stuck down here.\u201d Honey, \u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as you think. Networking\u2019s mostly what it comes to.\u201d Honey pulls out a pouch from underneath the couch cushions. I have a CORE so unbelievably powerful, it could stop Pyrrhon in her tracks, easy. The power\u2019s unregulated\u2014 one of her own. You could use this to get to the stars, easy. people would bow to you. You\u2019d be at her level. However This CORE is not yet complete. This CORE is the project of fifteen groups of people, just like you. Hundreds of thousands.. I\u2019ve lost count. There\u2019s too many. My days of fighting are over. I do not seek revenge. But you two\u2026 \u2026 Should you so desire, the next part of the CORE is located in the mountain. It is supplying a group of undead AI who named themselves \u201c The Datura .\u201d \u2026 If you must, I ask you proceed with caution. I don\u2019t want you to end up like everyone else. Gamma takes it at an almost comical speed. Honey laughs sadly. \u201cTo get up the mountain, you must go through hordes of CORES and AI. You have to travel through a forest which not even I have progressed.\u201d Gamma stops her. \u201cThen so be it! We don\u2019t make any difference here anyway!! We either live or live long enough to be killed, and if I even have the chance to make a difference, then why would I give that up?! I\u2019ll be killed, that\u2019s it. Yeah, I know! But, if I can at least\u2026\u201d Nea looks down, ashamed. Honey hesitates. \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a passion much like yours anymore, much less in a clone .\u201d Gamma stands up. \u201cBeing a clone doesn\u2019t mean jackshit! If yer here ta just rail on me for bein\u2019 one, then\u2014!\u201d \u201cTch!\u201d Honey stands up and forces her down. \u201cAll this this and that that yer goin\u2019 on about! Calm down!\u201d Gamma and Nea glance at each other awkwardly. \u201cWhat I mean ,\u201d Honey says. \u201cIs you\u2019ve got a heart. Not a great thing, but not a bad thing, either.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d Honey rubs her temples. \u201cI.. You two..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 are absolutely insufferable!! \u201d Honey groans. \u201cPack up! We\u2019re leaving tomorrow!\u201d Nea stiffens. \u201cWh-what?!\u201d \u201cYou heard me! Hey, Han! Get \u2018em a room! Chasmus, take it outta my check. I got work ta do, go pack up an\u2019 get up!\u201d \u201cw-we already have a\u2014\u201d \u201cLOCK \u2018EM UP!!!\u201d \u2026 So Gamma and Nea sleep for the night, and are awoken at 3 AM by Honeycakes. \u201cc\u2019mon! this is baby work!\u201d Honey swings her hammer over her shoulder. \u201cY\u2019all are pathetic! Overthrowing a world leader and ya can\u2019t even get up? C\u2019mon!\u201d \u2026 And they go to the mountain. CTSNE of Honey breaking down the rusty gates leading up. Gamma laughs. \u201cDamn! we\u2019ve got nothin ta worry about, huh?\u201d She puts her arms behind her head. \u201cWith that , you can even rival Omega!\u201d \u201c\u2026 The one who beat up Pyrrhon?\u201d Gamma nods. Nea perks up. \u201cY-yeah! they were the same color as you, Gamma!\u201d \u201cGen 3 clone!\u201d Gamma puffs up her chest. \u201cWe\u2019re the last sentient clones around coz of him! Hah!\u201d Honey scratches the back of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something to brag about.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d Gamma says, \u201cWhat Division were you? I was 12.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Honey says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to bash in skulls, not talk about your tragic backstory! Hurry up!!\u201d Stage 1 \u2014 Honey You play as Gamma and Nea for a bit until you get to a puzzle that only Honey can do. she chastises them and plows through it for them. You get to play as just her for the rest of the level, which isn\u2019t very much. Should be medium difficulty of more puzzles and exploration with minimal fighting until the end. Precision platforming Stage 2 \u2014 The Datura Small fighting sequence with the Datura AI. Gamma complains that they\u2019re stronger than usual and Honey snaps that it\u2019s the CORE. If it\u2019s the CORE you wanna get, it\u2019s the CORE you must defeat! This stage is more of a fighting stage than the last. After the first wave, you explore a small maze to heal, then fight a secondary wave. Stage 3 \u2014 Rattlesnake in the flowers Woah, the CORE is right there, unguarded! No, no it\u2019s not. Python\u2019s guarding it. Nea screams, exasperated. \u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?\u201d Honeycakes grips her hammer. \u201cWe\u2019re going after her!\u201d The walls suddenly begin to close in (they\u2019re indoors) and it\u2019s a speed precision race to the end of the level. If you do a secret level you can get Gamma\u2019s motorcycle Stage 4 \u2014 Python RUH roh it\u2019s the Datura again!!! You bash in a round until you encounter Python. Insert conversation Python boss fight obtain bit of CORE! \u201cIs that it?\u201d Asks Gamma. Honey shakes her head. \u201cNope. That bitch ass cut it up. Looks like the Datura got some. Let\u2019s kill em!\u201d Stage 5 \u2014 Venom Python again :skull: Gamma says, \u201cLeave us alone! We don\u2019t want nothing with you!\u201d Python Points towards Honey: \u201cIt\u2019s not you two I want.\u201d Honey/Python conflict G: H-hold on! Honey can\u2019t\u2014.. That .. Omega\u2019s a clone! Honey-Honey.. she\u2019s\u2014 P: and how do you think she obtained such a high power weapon? She hasn\u2019t worked with the temples to obtain magic, right, Nea? N: \u2026 P: And Gamma, your fists, they\u2019re magic, aren\u2019t they? G: but\u2026 P: And what does that make you, Honeycakes? Non-religious magic possessor? H: \u2026 H: \u2026 H: \u2026 It\u2019s been a while, Python. G: Honey\u2014?! (Honey swings out her hammer) P: Ah? I save your life, and this is the thanks I get?! H: Tch! P: A murderer, that\u2019s what you always were! Just take out my CORE like you never even knew me in the first place! I dare you! P: and you.. you\u2019ve got a following, don\u2019t you now? P: Hah.. hahah\u2026 you\u2019re probably lying to them, too huh?! P: PATHETIC!! P: Come on, Honey! P: Life\u2019s just a game, right?! Isn\u2019t that what you told me?! P: SO WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH FIGHTING TIL MY DEATH?!?! Battle start Something something. Fight her. Something else. Fight the Datura This is possibly the hardest fight here then. Well after that fiasco (survive long enough, lol. You can\u2019t defeat every single enemy, it\u2019s an endless wave until the timer runs out) and an unskippable death plays out. They are separated by Khan , with the last piece of the CORE, who comes to fully activate it. The blow upon activation is so insanely powerful that: Honey and Gamma are blown away Nea and Python are blown away. Chasmus is left alone. Stage 6 \u2014 Memory Cards Nea, Lane, Const, and Prodigal. Gamma and Nea wake up in a dingy alleyway in a common city. As they start to walk around, Nea gets a splitting headache and falls tot he ground. G: \u201cN\u2014.. Nea?! Are you okay?!\u201d N: \u201cGh .. damn\u2014.. damn fuckin\u2019 w.. ah..\u201d G: \u201c Oh.. Right, CORE density is much higher here.\u201d G: \u201cD-don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll get you somewhere safe!!\u201d N: \u201cI-.. I\u2019m sorry..\u201d Gamma hefts Nea on her back Oh shit it\u2019s Lane and Prodigal!! Prodigal kidnaps gamma, and leaves Nea on the ground. Cue quickly moving stage with hard obstacles. After the stage, small cutscene of Nea spying on Prodigal and her group (Lock, Lane, and Conte) and dragging Gamma away like a spider in a web. Nea tries to sneak out, but is caught by Conte and Lock who do a combo attack and kick her out. Cue Constantine They catch her as she falls. They\u2019d gone to D4 for business, but for some reason caught a nerualink of Gamma and decided to come over. Constantine is here to deliver a USB of blackmail to someone in the underworld. \u201cWell, what are you guys wanting for?!\u201d Nea points towards the giant building Prodigal ran off to. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Gamma!\u201d This dungeon.. is incredibly long! 4 waves of enemies, and 2 waves of puzzle. The first puzzle wave is just for entering the building, the other one is for getting to the 4th wave and then Prodigal. 2nd wave is more complicated. Each wave includes a different challenge (ie consistent bleed, projectiles, immobilized, more projectiles but it\u2019s bigger). At the end, they get into a glass elevator and go up to the sky. You can vaguely see the conflict with Khan, Python, and Honey, but they pay it no mind. When you finish, cut to Gamma. You walk out of your cage, and into an eerily quiet hallway. You find yourself back in Future, trying to escape. It\u2019s actually almost impossible to lose here; you have almost infinite health and deal insane damage. Upon reaching the end, you fall down onto Earth, look up, and\u2014! Oh, it\u2019s just Prodigal. You\u2019re tied up against a wall and she\u2019s staring at you intently. A bad robotic voice asks, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d Prodigal slams her fist the wall beside Gamma. \u201cDo you remember? What we did?\u201d \u201cAll those years..\u201d \u201cDo you remember Who helped you escape from Future?\u201d Do you remember anything? Nea and Constantine break in from the ceiling and throw Lock and Conte off the sides. Prodigal tries to escape through the ceiling, but Honey throws her down. Constantine gets Gamma off of the wall and Shenx looks around. And shit goes down. It basically escalates to puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal \u2192 puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal again, with Gamma 4life required. During the first puzzle, Lane says, \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her!!\u201d And once she is defeated, Prodigal takes her and runs away. During the second puzzle, Lane tries again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take her away from me!!\u201d But she ends up falling to the ground. Prodigal asks one more time. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d Gamma slides back and spits blood onto the ground \u201cHell no!\u201d Prodigal jams her against the wall and presses her thumb into Gamma\u2019s forehead When Gamma fell in future, she saw Pyrrhon, who held a gun. She also saw Prodigal. She remembers prodigal. Flashbacks of how Prodigal helped her before, helped her fight, Pyrrhon says, \u201cnight night~\u201d And the video glitches to black. Prodigal asks. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d The conversation Gamma: \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Gamma: \u201cAre you pleased with yourself?\u201d Gamma: \u201cDo you enjoy killing everybody in sight? Do you get some sorta sick high off of seeing people scream and cry and\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d .. You win.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing I lost.. Everything..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. What\u2019s left of me?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing that she\u2014\u201c Prodigal: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cThe consequences are far too great for me to return home empty handed.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease allow me to have this one thing. The only freedom I\u2019ll ever get.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI lost.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win, okay?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d [Gamma\u2019s hands fall to her side]. Prodigal: \u201c.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you can\u2019t- can\u2019t ever forgive me, but..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI have to thank you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI found you.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy sole reason for existence.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTo find you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma, you..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAs much as you hated me, I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t stand how they treated you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou remember, right? The cloning facility.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cA clone of my being..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d And yet, human despite it all.\u201d Prodigal: \u201d I couldn\u2019t let them take that away from you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cHahah. You ran away from me, didn\u2019t you? I was the reason you\u2019re here now with your scars and burnt edges.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you hated me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just\u2014..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c(shiver, cough)\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just really..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I can spend my last moments with you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy little sister..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cOhh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cH-hey\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPut my metal carcass of a soul to good use, okay?\u201d Gamma: \u201cPuh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProdigal, you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease just\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201cProdigal, are you\u2014!?\u201d [Prodigal flops down on the floor]. Prodigal: \u201c.. Please.\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhat are you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cShe took you away from me, and I\u2014\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. Your pitiful expression, that day..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt was too much for me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong for God to save me now.\u201d [Gamma grabs Prodigal\u2019s hand] Gamma: \u201cProdigal just\u2014!..\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhy\u2014.. Why couldn\u2019t you have\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201cYOU IDIOT!\u201d [Gamma slams the ground] Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!\u201d Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDNT YOU\u2014?!\u201d (Gamma wipes away tears) Gamma: \u201cI.. I could\u2019ve saved you, Prodigal..! I-I thought that\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI never hated you.\u201d Gamma: \u201cI know. I know but why\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201c.. Why coulnd\u2019t you have told me?\u201d Gamma: \u201cSo that I\u2014.\u201d Gamma: \u201c.. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cLook at you now.\u201d [Prodigal lifts a shaking hand onto Gamma\u2019s chest or hand] Prodigal: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d [Prodigal laughs quietly] Prodigal: \u201cOh, Gamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIf only I\u2014..\u201d Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. can spend my last moments..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cwith you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy baby sister..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProd-.. PRODIGAL?!\u201d Prodigal fucking SHOOTS herself Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL! WAKE UP! PRODIGAL! PRODIGAL!\u201d [Gamma shakes Prodigal frantically, but her core flies out]. Prodigal faded away into the night, melting away with the distant summer sun. The only fading memory of Prodigal, her CORE, the very bane of her existence, rests in Gamma\u2019s bloodied hands. \u2026 Gamma equips Prodigal\u2019s CORE. \u2026 \u2026 Lane shows up beside Gamma, and stares at Prodigal\u2019s empty carcass. A slash, and Lane is also nothing but a desecrated corpse. \u2026 \u2026 Nea reconvenes with Gamma, who is still, and can\u2019t move. She hugs Gamma, who passes out upon touch. \u2026 \u2026 Honey\u2019s CORE is one half fuller. Prodigal had the third piece. \u2026 \u2026 Act 3: The Hive Crossing Over the Line Refresh your memory, or when you wanna be, the Phantom\u2019s on the way, She\u2019s coming down the street. Summer lights, seems to me, I\u2019m in a dream. This summer night\u2026 Huangzhi Khan, Python, Honey, Kai, and The Avatar . Back at the Slaughterhouse, Gamma\u2019s finally woken back up. She doesn\u2019t seem to feel like talking, but says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d anyway. the CORE\u2019s one half fuller. two more chunks to go. One is with Python, the other with someone else however, the conflict with Prodigal brought Honey\u2019s CORE to the attention of Pyrrhon, who set off after them. As they leave The Slaughterhouse, Gamma, Nea, and Honey are tracked down by police and chased. if you get caught it\u2019s a game over\u2014 you have to run to the next town over before they give up. This town is similar to a beehive. They throw a man to the ground as they go and he is shot down by police. Due to Honey\u2019s mass amount of strength, she is mistaken for a temple leader and is whisked away. Gamma and Nea are left alone. Follow Honey, she tries to fight but is put down by what looks like DGM CROW\u2019s talismans. Turns out the guy that they killed at the entrance was a high level temple leader\u2026 Nea has a panic attack as she realizes he died (shot by police). They currently mistake Honey to be that man. He didn\u2019t have a determinable gender so they just say she\u2019s a girl. she makes up a bullshit response which is obviously fake but fucking works anyway. You learn a small bit of her past through a flashback. Gamma and Nea sneak into her room via the window at the top of her ceiling. She\u2019s happy! At this time, you can now do side quests in this town. it\u2019s recommended you do at least one so you can unlock the inns and shops in this town. When they go outside, Honey sees Python. She summons her hammer ready to strike\u2014 She holds a small girl by her ponytail, and plugs the CORE into her. ??? \u201c\u2026 P\u2014.. Python..?\u201d P \u201cShh.. shh, you\u2019re still weak. Are you okay?\u201d ??? \u201cMy-my master, he\u2014..\u201d P \u201cshh.. it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay.\u201d ??? \u201cP-Python, I\u2014.. I\u2019m so sorry, y-you..\u201d P \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. It wasn\u2019t that hard, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Python puts her injured arm behind her back and continues to stroke the girl\u2019s head. \u2026 \u2026 You can choose to still attack Python or not Attacked The bad ending. You strike, and Python flinches. You have struck the girl and killed her. Python stares at the girl in tears. H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201dYou-..\u201d H \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Honey.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d a DDLC esque glitch sequence sends Honey back to her room. Knock Knock Knock, Honey\u2019s woken up by guns. Gamma and Nea are nowhere to be found. She prioritizes herself and runs out of a really fucking dangerous dungeon outside of the town. She slips and falls suddenly, and someone puts their feet on her back. Huangzhi says, \u201cI got her. Take her in.\u201d The police show up, lead by Python. the CORE is implemented into her , embedded in to her back. \u201c\u2026 Police, dismiss. I will handle her.\u201d they disperse. \u201dThis is our fight, Honey.\u201d \u201dWill you fight me, or die like a dog?\u201d The hardest boss fight in the game starts here, lol. it\u2019s kind of impossible to win and it generally just encourages you to go show mercy to Python, the longer route. If you manage to beat her with just Honey on two lives, you wrench the CORE out of her back and kill her. Python is dead, but the CORE is 25% fuller. you return to the town like nothing happened. Mercy The good ending. You just get up and leave. Nearby guards ask Honey if she saw an intruder, but she declines. P. \u201c\u2026\u201d H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P. \u201cThanks.\u201d Python leaves with the girl. She leaves behind a really good weapon upgrader. Alright, so! You return back to your room. You might want to add more stuff in here. So you go into the hallway: Khan, and a few other people are there. While you try to refuse walking into the room, they refuse you.. haha. They talk to Honey and vaguely hint that they know who she is. When her fingers inch towards her Kendama, they tie her up immidletly and throw her at the bottom of an arena. Huangzhi sits there with Khan, twirling a key. \u201cGo.\u201d All of the NPCs from the town or temple attack you. When you get closer\u2026 Khan takes the CORE off of the pedestal, and then inserts it into a little boy. He attacks Honey. After winning (or, \u2018winning\u2019), Honey is thrown back and almost gets hit, until the attack is blocked\u2026 \u201cJust like old times, huh?\u201d It\u2019s Python! Similarly to the Ummu fight, she assists you. After the fight, there\u2019s a looong scene of an explosion. You seem to have won, the temple is in shambles, and no one can be seen. And then a missile is shot into Python\u2019s back. You have two seconds to press \u201cx\u201d to grab. if you don\u2019t, then the (INSERT GANG HERE) will attack you. if you do, they will stop and provide healing every now and then. That\u2019s the only difference it has. You catch a mild glimpse of PYRRHON. She saw you. She knows Honey runs with Python through the forest while being chased by Pyrrhon, who runs at lightspeed. Honey is thrown off of a cliff\u2014 She starts to fall, is this how it ends? I never even got to meet my mother, I never even got to.. I worked so hard.. is this the life I get? her hands are grabbed by Python, who\u2019s leaning off of a boat controlled by Gamma and Nea. She\u2019s hoisted onto the boat and runs off. As they hop back on land, the boat crashes but no one pays it any mind. A gang of bandits suddenly come out with knives. Gamma and Nea step forward to protect Honey. \u201cStand down\u201d, says Python. \u201cIt\u2019s solved.\u201d There\u2019s a group of groans and they all walk away. \u201cYou were going to AMBUSH me?!\u201d \u201cI DIDN\u2019T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO REACT!!\u2019 \u201cREACT TO WHAT?!?!?!?\u201d Gamma and Nea look at each other and sigh. Camera pan. Python sits atop the cliff, and gestures Khan away. Huangzhi later comes over, but he is thrown into the ocean. End of act 3. End of act three. Act 4: Late Loves Lamentations The world\u2019s on fire. After the HIVE, Nea and Gamma go to a nearby cave where they see Rhaika Lei making a campfire and meditating. You can rest with him. Upon interacting with him, he just opens one of his eyes, but says nothing, and goes back to normal. Behind him, there\u2019s a door you can go into. It\u2019s a gorgeous place, reminiscent of an old Catholic Church. At the center, there\u2019s a small statue and sword that is embedded into the chest of a small girl. It\u2019s a human girl. This is a cutscene. You can take it out, but Rhaika Lei will rush in and throw a dagger at your face. He doesn\u2019t talk again, but you do duke it out again. If you win, he staggers back. He chokes on his own words. You pull out the sword. \u201cWho dares disturb my slumber?\u201d Blah blah blah. Rhaika Lei spits out a black glob, which manifests itself into a spider and crawls into the statue. He starts coughing and sputtering. It\u2019s then that the statues eyes light up, and you\u2019re trapped in a dungeon, congrats. There\u2019s a broken fridge in there which flickers to life. You have to pay though. lol. Rhaika Lei is unconscious beside you, but he\u2019s holding a USB which you can insert into a cyborg. It details the tale of Kei, Kai, and Pyrrhon\u2019s conquest against God. It brings into question that there is more than known. Rhaika Lei snaps the USB out of you, then runs away. When you see him next, he\u2019s inserted it into an old mech, which he tries to use to fight you, but is stricken down by Kai, who descends down. \u201cThere is no need for your services, Rhaika Lei. You have done well. And you four\u2026 why have you summoned me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cYou expelled a curse for..?\u201d \u201cFor fun.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d Kai slumps down. \u201c\u2026 Do you need my help?\u201d \u201cYeah, wanna stop a world leader with us?\u201d Gamma jokes. Kai laughs and says sure. As the party member screen opens, it\u2019s cut in half. Kai is sputtering for breath. Her blood leaks into Rhaika Lei\u2019s dead corpse. Prequel Story + LORE (my first draft,, i lost the other one) XD It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Earth, in 2XXX. 2012, God fell from the heavens. Angels crashed and burned, and all left behind in the slaughter was a small, gleaning green gem. That\u2019s the PRODIGAL CORE, rumored to be the Core of life itself, the heart of God Himself. From the \u201crapture\u201d, as it was called, 75% of Earth was wiped out. 75% of Earth is \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d, and 25% is all under control of Pyrrhon . Pyrrhon\u2019s the maniacal maniac who harnessed the full power of the PRODIGAL CORE and brought Earth from the depths of hell: for a cost. All you need to know is now, Pyrrhon is in complete and total control of earth and its inhabitants. She runs \u201cOZ\u201d, the world IS OZ. There may be a government, but OZ holds so much power that they are completely powerless. Should OZ be brought down, so would the entire economy of the planet. Pyrrhon is a scientist, as mentioned. She and her friend, Reever, specifically had an interest in human experimentation. One of my many interests is human cloning! You might be able to see where this is going. All clones and nuclear experiments are done on small asteroid planets. One particularly noted is called FUTURE, where a lot of clones are produced. you might see the name \u201cGamma\u201d mentioned\u2014 she is a clone from here! In OZ, there\u2019s sub-categories. One of these sub categories is the NATIONAL GUARDIAN team. A national guardian is basically the only good job you can get without nepotism. On the outside, you fight. Defend the country. Become police, etc. that\u2019s it. Then you join the National guardian team. \u2014\u2014 It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Marian signs away to the National Guardian\u2014 a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him. He is placed in a group with a grumpy old man as his leader, and another boy, named Khan. Khan has joined hte national guardian team to garner funds for his sister, who has unfortunately died before this point but now he can\u2019t really leave. It\u2019s here that they\u2019re given a CORE A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There\u2019s a rumor that Pyrrhon was the one who killed God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it? A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action. Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN\u2019s whole lifetime can\u2019t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful. You level up your CORE using other\u2019s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth. You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE\u2019s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it. The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist. Now, in order to clone, you need eggs to produce them in. A girl named Chou is a donor, and has been for the past year or so. She\u2019s developed a platonic relationship with Khan, so he lives on for her. Anyway Anyway I forgot most of what happens in the prequel story, but blah blah blah immortality blah blah blah, Khan and Marian are homoerotic enemies blah blah blah Chou joins their team,here\u2019s where things get really bad. Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Whether it be his hard head and big muscles or his strange moral compass, she loves him. And she can do whatever she wants with him. \u201cIt doesn't have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon, \u201cIt just has to be you .\u201d \u2026. On November 12, 2XXX, a child is born. That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. He goes on his last mission with Khan and Chou, putting down a rebellion against Oz by a small group called The Last Hope, and Marian is so DONE. He gazes into Nea\u2019s eyes, He realizes that he really does love Nea. Marian refuses to fight from this point on. He gives his magically-infused scarf to Khan, a soft kiss, and then runs into the night. Khan can only stare in awe. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201dI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. (first dra Pre-Established Basically, Khan and Marian were lumped in with this grumpy ass old man. I think Pyrrhon saw their backgrounds (Khan joined to get funds for his little sister, who was ill) and Marian ran away from his religious training and said \u201cfuck you brah\u201d so she put them with the worst possible guy. So this grumpy old man worked their asses off, to try to get into this huge competition in an arena, so that they\u2019d become National guardians. So they train and train and hate each other and love each other a little, and they end up winning that competition and make it into the national guardian association. Khan becomes kind of an egotistical BITCH at this time and leaves Marian who kind of set him up for the final blow which had them win. Marian sulks around, and he wanders back to his old hut with his master, and oh my god he\u2019s fuckign dead :sob: He doesn\u2019t even tell Khan, he just buries his master by himself. While in the forest, he meets this tiny little girl named Chou. She\u2019s bright blue (like gamma) and missing one eye. She\u2019s relaly, really scared like trembling shaking crying .. he feels pity for her and takes her to the infirmary. She actually thinks that Marian is Khan for some reason, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Anyway, it turns out that Khan\u2019s sister actually fucking died a long time ago, so he took Chou under his wing to take care of. But since he\u2019s been too busy doing whatever shit he does, she\u2019s been lonely. Marian like an idiot, leaves her, and brawls with Marian for like, three hours. He does actually apologize and realize his wrongs, goes to Chou, and they both \u201cadopt\u201d her, basically. Chou is part of the genetic testing batch and was chosen to be a gene donor to some of the clones, so she\u2019s whisked away. They both stop by a bar and kinda go over what\u2019s happened to them so far. How far they\u2019ve come. How they\u2019re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. Actually, before this time, Marian and Pyrrhon had their, uhm! Their run in. So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. Anyway, they end up putting TLH to rest here, and Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019d say. But it can happen! I promise you.\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian joins a small temple in the middle of nowhere. Climbs up the ranks. brings Nea, who;d been born, with him. And Pyrrhon.. OLD DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. After Nea escapes from Future, she has a run in with some guy and Point helps her get a CORE outta one of the PiBots. So, she does that. Gamma comes along and screams, outta my way! She takes that CORE. Point tells Nea to get out. if you get out, you can\u2019t because Gamma challenges you and is like \u201cIzzat point? Goddamn! He really won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d \u201cFive second rule, yk? Gotta get it fresh.\u201d She jams your transmissions and then you fight. The same thing happens if you walk towards her, just with different intro dialogue. *YOU CAN ONLY DEFEAT GAMMA USING A BLOCKBUSTER, or whatever the equal is. It\u2019s because she\u2019s metal and she\u2019s weak to Magic. Dream magic and reg Magic should be a thing. Nea uses Dream Magic She gives up after the first hit from the blockbuxaster and then Gamma just leaves because her pride is hurt. She throws you the CORE and hops away. Okay so you leave into the forest and then uh oh, it\u2019s Gamma. She staggers towards you and begs for a truce. She even gives you her powerbank, which she\u2019s using to power her PiCORE, since she has no external energy to grab. You guys can talk. You can ask her how she knows Point, or who she is. She dances around answering about Point, but they were in the resistance before together :) they tried getting together, and actually kissed! But Gamma is a lesbian (point is gay too) so they don\u2019t really like each other, but they\u2019re just too embarrassed. They kissed before the resistance force shelter was bombed. OH OH SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT where you\u2019re from! \u201cThe over world..? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d She gets all sentimental on you. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like? I hear it\u2019s being overrun by politicians right now\u2026 Oh, really? There\u2019s really no safe space on Earth anymore, huh?\u201d \u201cYou need to talk to Point? .. Oh.\u201d She gives you her powerbank (like just shoves it in her hands), stating that she doesn\u2019t need it anymore. She needs it to fight, but she says that it\u2019s getting harder to fight. It\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m so tired.. Gamma suddenly collapses. A small hologram states that she\u2019s very low on power. Nea just tucks Gamma into the bed next to her. The powerbank and her transmitter are on the side, she hasn\u2019t used it yet. She kinda thKhans about it, before drifting off to sleep\u2026 HOLY FUCK ITS PRODIGAL Prodigal comes along and fucking BURNS the forest down. Nea slams the powerbank back into Gamma, who gets up. She\u2019s stuck in her PiBot mode since Nea is bad with computers. Gamma scares Prodigal off, and then there\u2019s a shot of her amidst the fire, and looking back, like the eclair cyborg picture I had. She extends a hand, and they fly off. You can either get Nea\u2019s route maybe or you can get Tsao and Khan maybe.. Pre-DEMOlition Bijyun opening: A few glitches in the opener when you log in and when you immediately leave afterward. Gamestyle: A short hack-n-slash tutorial. Quick-paced and gets you over the basics, which include: Grappling hooks Basic movement controls Extremely basic fighting controls + crouch/crouch attacks Not too long for the tut sequence, but a little longer for the fighting sequence. \u201cWhew! You okay there, Gamma? Back on track, \u2018Kay? Get going!\u201d Afterward, you get a semi-glitched cutscene, and Gamma falls to the ground. Guess what happened here? Pyrrhon glitched Gamma\u2019s memories! All glitching is actually the memories she had with Prodigal She lands in Marian\u2019s abandoned temple with her motorcycle, the Comet. Cut to Gamma at her new job. \u201c\u2026 And now I\u2019m here. Working under the same person, same conditions, just somewhere else.\u201d A testing sequence, 1v1 battle against a harder foe + a few troop waves. As she tosses it up into the air (carelessly), it\u2019s shot out of her hands and Prodigal fucking eats it. Anim.cut where Gamma loses her job. She\u2019s pretty unreliable anyway. \u201cBut I\u2014!\u201d \u201cOn , you failed to retrieve \u2019s heart\u201d On ___ you took Lock\u2019s left lung for your own personal gain\u201d Etc. it\u2019s actually extremely funny how unreliable she is. They throw her over the side of the fucking building because she gets into a fight She lands, hard. She\u2019s gasping for air, but somehow still clinging onto the life she once had. \u2026 and then Nea falls next to her. She isn\u2019t in as much pain as Gamma, but that throw was supposed to kill, so thank God for Gamma being there to break her fall. \u201c\u2026 Got fired too?\u201d Says Gamma. Nea gasps for air. \u201c\u2026 yeah.\u201d They just kind of, sit there. It\u2019s raining, they\u2019re basically going to die. There\u2019s nowhere to go. They\u2019re both bleeding out into each other. That\u2019s what Nea says, at least. Gamma tries to keep them both awake, but they both end up collapsing from blood loss. Potential Shenx meeting instead of Huangzhi, who takes them both and says \u201chey Prodigal is being really mean to us and we need you guys to take her out.\u201d Gamma was an experiment to make a clone as \u2018human\u2019 as possible. Prodigal was the second part to make the clone as robotic as possible. With this, they studied how they fared in battle situations. Prodigal was genuinely fucking FASCINATED with Gamma, like obsessively, and stalked her around. Gamma really hated Prodigal for that. Actually, Gamma was barely aware of Prodi\u2019s existence. Pyrrhon did everything in her power to keep them separated. This is where the \u201cProdigal Boss\u201d Lore comes into play. She finds Gamma with Nea, who she sort of just observes from a distance. Think Hornet, from Hollow Knight, or Road, from D. Gray-Man. Yes, she causes all sorts of issues, but they never come face to face. But tensions build. At the end of a chase scene, Nea stabs down Prodigal. Prodigal doesn\u2019t even fight, and only falls limply to the ground.

Hint at Pyrrhon fucking abusing the SHIT out of Prodigal. After Prodigal kills herself, the building begins to stumble, but the image is burned into Nea\u2019s mind of someone stabbing herself by Nea\u2019s Own Sword. Gamma grabs them both and runs.

She\u2019s not allergic\u2014 did you know thai8t Clones have extremely strict dietary restrictions? Ref to the acid reflux. Someone (who is a little easily seen from the background) hops out and basically like, fucking guts her. I\u2019m kidding. What she does is open the latch on her stomach which pours out some of the stomach acid. Gamma shakily gets up. \u201c\u2026 wh-who..?!\u201d \u201cYer lucky you\u2019re a gen 3 clone. Any higher an\u2019 ya would\u2019ve died already.\u201d Gamma\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re a c\u2014!!\u201d \u201cSame batch as you. Humanities, Div 3. Pleased to meetcha.\u201d Honey shakes her hand. \u201cYou can call me Honey. \u2018S what my friend calls me. Any other name an\u2019 I gut ya you for parts, \u2018Kay?\u201d \u201c\u2026 Gamma.\u201d \u201cA pleasure. Where ya headed?\u201d \u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The story so far is explained with a fade to black. Honey puts her hands behind her back. \u201cYou wanna find \u2018em?\u201d Gamma nods. \u201cSaw sum suspicious figures while I was fishin\u2019. Old fart and bratty monk.\u201d \u201cMonk?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got the marking\u2019s of one. Star an\u2019 refined magic an everything. \u201c\u2026 Huh.\u201d \u201cProlly resigned if she\u2019s talkin with you. | Ah, look at that. We\u2019re here.\u201d (Opening to the new island, the one where Honey and Constantine are. The one that\u2019s a Baguio/Bontoc replica). \u201cBut-but\u2014!\u201d \u201cShh. Yer injured. I\u2019ve adopted you. I\u2019m obligated to.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat, wanna go fight?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just leave them!\u201d Honey kind of stares at her for a second, and then punches her. She flies across the map and ragdoll collides with the window barriers. Very loose physics. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even beat me, how do you expect to save your friends?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cSee? Okay. I get a discount, since my girlfriend works there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Khan and Nea are tied up and about to be thrown into the incinerator. Khan says something about her father, and then\u2014! \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me and not her,\u201d says Nea. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t see me like this,\u201d says Khan, to Marian (depending on who you\u2019re playing as). Honey and Gamma show up, and you do an equally fun aoe damage dungeon with them instead. Khan and Honey give each other glares at the end but Nea and Gamma are happy to see each other again. \u201cSo, now what?\u201d Gamma and Nea sit at the edge of the cliff and point towards Pyrrhon\u2019s empire in the distant summer sunset. \u201cThere.\u201d Cool perspective shot of all of them, then the chapter ends. One Shots and Whatnot Species Chibao (Khan, Clementine, and Rhaikha-Lei). ChiBao\u2019s live for a very long time, they\u2019re like the elf equivalent in CORE. It is a male dominated culture, with women being very rare and held at utmost care. When you think of magic capabilities, these are the ones you think of. These are the pioneers of magic creation, even the controversial refined magic. From the start to the end, magic has run through the veins of the ChiBao. Stats They tend to lean towards speed and offense with low Defense and HP. This is because they don\u2019t usually get hit in general and use ranged attacks most often. This can vary between personalities. Physical Appearances Easily defined by their slender figures and pure white eyes, the ChiBao originated as a small tribe around Southeast Asia. They wear makeup made of ashes around their eyes. On occasion, they will wear the ashes of their enemies when going into war. Traditional clothing includes long, flowing hair (typically braids) and long scarves or other forms of clothing. This symbolizes their long lives. Due to their environment, their colors are usually warm/brownish colors. Their hands are absurdly large and calloused. They don\u2019t shave off their callouses, since it serves as a natural protection against their strong magic. History The ChiBao are credited for the first recordings of asexual reproduction that wasn\u2019t cloning. This was later tabooed. Their cells are completely incompatible with other species, so they can\u2019t have other mixes of children. They eat the other ones up like acid. Consequently, there are very little ChiBao in existence today, so they\u2019re held in generally high regard. They are a very \u2018purist\u2019 tribe, since they are physically incapable of mixing with other species. Their religion, however, is open to any species, gender, and color. Chiru (Nea, Chasmus, Marian, and Shenx). More magic-oriented than Inozha, but much less than the ChiBao. The \u2018unicorns\u2019 of CORE. They are so widespread, that there is no one tradition that the Chiru adapt. They instead adapt of wherever they are staying in. The most average of all the species. Stats It varies between personality, but they tend to lean more towards offense OR defense. There is not one or the other. They tend to use short-ranged attacks due to their size. Physical appearance It\u2019s very common for them to be short and stubby legged, but a few have had absurd growth spurts which boost them to normal height. Since their legs are abnormal, they are prone to injury. Many people have surgery or \u2018splints\u2019 inserted into their legs, like Huangzhi. Nea simply doesn\u2019t run very often for this fact. They have a lot of color variation, but go more towards cool, dark colors. Chiru are known for having the fastest hair growth out of anyone else. History They originally began as a small nomad tribe who picked up various other wanderers of other cultures and species. Because of this.. cesspool, they eventually grew strong together and took over large parts of the Earth. they are so widespread that there is no stereotype that could fit any of them. Inozha (Constantine, Shou, Pyrrhon, Han, Hal, Clementine, and Coda) The secondary average tribe, but with no magic. Absolutely none. The \u2018red blooded Americans\u2019. Also extremely widespread, but stereotyped to be big, burly, and aggressive. The \u201cearth ponies\u201d. stats Extreme offense! It\u2019s very, very rare for them ever to rely on anything else! Brute force, amiriight?! Physical Appearance Extreme color variety, from skin color to colors. These are the species that popularized clothing. Very fashionable and adaptable. They have small bodies but are extremely quick and powerful. history They came in very late to the whole Stickfigure sub species scene, and when they did, they brought up the Industrial Revolution. They brought clothes, colonization, money, technology, etc to both magic oriented tribes. Because of their alliance with the Chiru, Chiru lost touch of their extreme magic capabilities over time. The Inozha are heavily credited towards .. capitalism and business. Nai (Honey, Gamma, Kei, Kai, Prodigal, Python, Huangzhi, and Chou). A simple term used to describe those who don\u2019t fall into any of those categories. Everyone in here is mostly a clone.","title":"Previous Records"},{"location":"Notion/Previous%20Records/#i-want","text":"There\u2019s this gang of animal-like people. They\u2019re actually trying to revive a dead religion and all believe that they are one with the spirits of their warrior ancestors. They are not. Gamma and Nea seek freedom To disrupt Pyrrhon\u2019s control, which seems impossible. MAYBE go back to the video game plot; the one where Pyrrhon is self aware They will do this by constructing the ULTIMATE CORE! Using theft Trading/bartering At first: nea is fired whatergver Brawl with Gamma \u201cFuck you!\u201d \u201cFuck you!\u201d Get lost in forest. \u201cOh it\u2019s you\u201d. Gamma and Nea meet from a peace treaty. Instead of Prodigal, they are initially followed by Commander Vee. He wants to kill both of them simply to raise his hierarchal status. \u201cWhat luck, that I\u2019d find two beautiful girls, all trapped in here like this! Come now!\u201d Nea: this guy got me fired! Gamma: this guy got me fired! They run away and he\u2019s really mad so he chases them around. Now: Run around to get information and more gear Ok so they hide under the bar tables when Vee shows up to the slaughterhouse. They see how he threatens Shenx and brags about how he can leave this useless slum anytime he wants, and he has a home up there in the heavens. It\u2019s fact checked by Gamma\u2014 he does! They now want to kill him to get that. However they have no fuckin idea where he is. This guy\u2019s all bark no bite.. if we can get ahold of his stuff, we\u2019d be rich beyond belief! We gotta kill this guy! \u201cYou might wanna talk to your brother, Gamma.\u201d \u201cH-huh?! How\u2019d you\u2014?!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve (shnx and const) been friends for decades. \u2018Course I know who you are.\u201d Nea: (Maybe this girl is useful. Hah). Constantine is over in (Baguio!) Cue them being productive and encountering a few sidequests: Eskalion\u2019s attack patterns ATK one: Starts from one side of the stage, and runs at you at blinding speeds. It\u2019ll damage you if you\u2019re in the middle of it. He teleports and reappears above you and does one of two things A) he will shoot DIRECTLY BELOW HIM B) he will shoot to both corners of the room. Then he will disappear and reappear either grabbing at the walls or on the ground, preparing to fight again. If he\u2019s on the wall, he will shoot in your general direction four times, teleport behind you, (he will linger so you can counter or move away), and swing. The swing is really big, but so is his cooldown. If he\u2019s on the ground, he can: shoot at you with his gun jump up (From jumping up, he can either guard and reflect all bullets back at the player, OR he can throw a bomb. It basically goes in a straight line and can go as far as like, 25% of the room. So from the starting point (when he throws it) and when it ends, it bounces three times. Then, it\u2019ll explode into large pillars which reach to the top of the room). lunge again At 25% health, he\u2019ll crawl up to the top of the room, and swing around on a chandelier. He will shoot at you hysterically and you can\u2019t deal any damage, so you just have to avoid it or guard. After that, he\u2019s in a ravenous state and has increased speed, but lowered defense. His atk is much much higher thoughSo after this you probably get an introduction to Constantine and CORE buffs. End Once he dies, I\u2019ll initiate Prodigal/Balach\u2019s arc, HORRAY! So upon death, he crawls over to the wall, while Gamma puts a gun in his head. He starts rambling incoherently about \u201cGod\u2019s divine Will\u201d, \u201crevenge\u201d, \u201cthe Goddess\u201d, and other nonsensical religious bullshit. He then lets out a final plea of himself being a prophet or whatever, general religious psychosis talk. Then, he reaches out to the wall, and presses a big red button (which was once enclosed in a glass container). After that, the windows all shatter, and Prodigal jumps in. Vee starts talking to her and asks if she\u2019s proud of him, but she just shoots him. Gamma and Nea are frozen in fear. Prodigal ignores them, and throws his limp body across the room, like a child playing with a toy. She then rips his head off and plays with his entrails. Yay! The screen blacks out and Prodigal is gone, Gamma and Nea both passed out. All that\u2019s left is black goop and Vee\u2019s gun, which you can take and use. Now, Gamma and Nea were trying to kill Vee so that they could get his ID shard, fake his identity, and rob him and the other corpos + get into restricted areas. However Prodigal broke it. Lmfao. Anyway the cops start to show up, so a cutscene plays where they just run out of the building.That\u2019s the end of the chapter. So there\u2019s a huge explosion and Gamma and Nea are blown away. They both wake up seeing Honey, but they dont know who she is. She drops them on the ground, flicks over a business card, then leaves. Cut to the Baguio place festival. Gamma is looking. ok basically if you go to Prodigal, you go to the Akira collesum It\u2019s basically dogtown. \u201cRumor has it, it\u2019s completely outta Pyrrhon\u2019s control. Being in No Man\u2019s Land, an\u2019 everything\u2026 bet ya haven\u2019t heard of it, huh? Let me show ya \u2018round.\u201d \u201dexcuse you! Everyone knows about this place.\u201d \u201cYeah.. I\u2019ve only heard rumors.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s.. oddly quiet.\u201d \u201dYeah, no merchants jumping out, huh? Hah. Guess if yer here, you\u2019re here coz ya know what you want. They don\u2019t need to sell you nothin\u2019. They got corpos an\u2019 war criminals, all in one place.\u201d \u201dHuh..\u201d \u201dHeard you could get up to the space station if you had enough money.. well, you can get anything if you have enough money.\u201d (Cue guy selling organs) \u201d\u2026 uh huh. So, who are we lookin\u2019 for, again?\u201d (Point). PREDEM II FINAL DUNGEON The lives we\u2019ve left behind And whatever God is left for us. \u201cThe factory\u2019s been abandoned for some time now. But it started pumping out materials again!\u201d \u201cHuh? What is the factory? Well, it was from the RAPTURE, it\u2019s got some of Pyrrhon\u2019s old radiators. If someone tries hard enough, they could make a bomb, but\u2014..\u201d \u201cH-hey!! Where are you two rascals going?!\u201d \u201cThis is it,\u201d Says Nea. \u201cLet\u2019s end this,\u201d Says Gamma. Get in the side scroller mode for a period of time and hijack a ship entering from the factory. Fight through it with the terrain changing due to the changes in altitude. You play as Gamma first when they agree to split up. You go through a large wave of enemies and hit the button to stop the power flow, but the ship still goes. It\u2019s up to Nea. Cutscene of Nea running along the side of the ship and into Balach\u2019s chamber. Follow him through a third wave in the storage cavity. \u201cHAHAHAH\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re pathetic, Nea!\u201d \u201cJust try to find me!\u201d you can\u2019t actually find him. Break through the door and walk through it, and get pinned to the ground by Balach. \u201cHah..!\u201d each line of dialogue takes off like, 10% of your remaining HP. \u201cLook at you! Pathetic!\u201d \u201cYOU took EVERYTHING from me!\u201d \u201cHahhah.. hahah .. look at you,\u201d \u201cWEAK!! YOU\u2019RE WEAK, NEA!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all you are. A fuckin mindless puppet of your father.\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE HIDEOUS!\u201d Balach kicks her. Nea\u2019s HP falls to 0. \u201cHah..\u201d \u201cFutile, as always.\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know my end goal with you.\u201d Balach flicks a switch which turns on a screen on top of every single school, temple, and family. \u201cYou see, Nea?\u201d \u201cHahah. You didn\u2019t even know.\u201d \u201cNow, your CORE\u2026\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the only one powerful enough besides myself.\u201d \u201cHeheh..\u201d \u201cWait here, whore .\u201d Balach leaves. Nea rolls over and regenerates one HP. He walks in and nudges her with his foot. \u201c\u2026 You\u2019re still awake?\u201d \u201cI should\u2019ve killed you, all those years ago.\u201d \u201cYou and your father.\u201d \u201cHah.\u201d \u201cRemember that day? You remember it well.\u201d \u201cI did plan on Pyrrhon. What I didn\u2019t plan on was his suicide. And you .\u201d \u201cThat CORE,\u201d He grabs Nea\u2019s chest. \u201cThat CORE is mine .\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cGive it up, Nea. Give it to me.\u201d Nea limply falls, but says one thing: \u201c\u2026 You killed him?\u201d Balach doesn\u2019t listen and takes out a knife. Nea grabs it. \u201cDad..\u201d \u201c...\u201d \u201cMy dad...\u201d Congrats to you and Nea for unlocking her secondary ULT!!~ ULT: BLOOD DRIVE is now active! Nea gathers all the blood seeped into the floor and revives herself with it. Whether enemy or stick, it\u2019s hers now. She fights Balach again, who\u2019s basically a dummy. He goes through the same cycle but you just deal infinitely more damage than he does. You chase after him and break all his shields until you pummel him into the ground, like the real ground, since youre in the sky. The dust settles. He\u2019s nothing but a CORE. Nea looks around. She\u2019s right next to a body of water, and a mysteriously burnt pillar. A nearby old and wet paper drifts in the wind. Versailles.. Nea crushes Balach\u2019s CORE, And falls asleep. Gamma falls to the ground in a nearby parachute, picks Nea up, and walks home. End of act one. From Now on Our primary goals after chapter One is character development and slower plot progression. CHARA GOAL: Focus on Gamma or Nea or Honey or Python Choice, can be done in any order. DRIVING FORCE End goal: stop Pyrrhon. Short term: Grow Stronger get PB CORE\u2019s for story progression. Stars EQ \u201cThere are five total maj chords we need in order to weaken Pyrrhon and nullify her core output. They\u2019re here.\u201d After all that, they get the goal and have one final life-changing event, then leads into the finale. Act 2: The Arena. I had a thought.. Now, CORE has a cool mechanic where you do not kill a single enemy. You knock them out. They will infinitely respawn once you take too long and until you reach the next area. You don\u2019t have to kill them, but you will get more rewards from the more you do. \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019 is a rule Nea and Gamma stand by, since they\u2019re mostly fighting clones and Nea is obligated from religion. It goes something like this. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks since Balach\u2019s death and Nea\u2019s evolution. She\u2019s still recovering from the magic overload. She\u2019s fine, I guess. Since we\u2019re alone, I\u2019ll tell ya, I\u2019m kinda jealous. I wish I could be as good as her. I wish I was useful. Goddamnit, look at the time! My food\u2019s ready! See ya later!\u201c CTSCNE Honeycakes swings a fish onto the table and begins to skin it. Chasmus takes the chopped pieces from earlier and pours it into a pot. Han takes a finished plate and carries it out. From above, Prodigal and Lane snicker. Prodigal reaches down to take the plate. Han looks around, confused. Chasmus looks angry and Han looks back, sheepishly. Prodigal hands the kebab to Lane, who eats it happily and giggles. They kick their feet off the roof and gaze off into the sky. Camera shifts and fades into the upper left. Khan is sharpening his sword from atop a mountain. Python is starting a nearby fire out of old parts and notices the town. The fireworks explode. Gamma and Nea walk through the town. \u201cHeheh! I told ya!\u201d \u201cWhatever, sure! Heh. Ow!!\u201d \u201cOops, sorry. I had this idea\u2026 Honey and Gamma become friends, almost immediately. It\u2019s quick, like a gust of wind. They talk, inside the restaurant. It\u2019s a dog eat dog world out there, they both know. Gamma says, \u201cDude, if I were rich, I\u2019d go up into the stars.. You know, the interplanetary cities? We can live it up there. Hah! \u2018s impossible though, we\u2019re stuck down here.\u201d Honey, \u201cIt\u2019s not as hard as you think. Networking\u2019s mostly what it comes to.\u201d Honey pulls out a pouch from underneath the couch cushions. I have a CORE so unbelievably powerful, it could stop Pyrrhon in her tracks, easy. The power\u2019s unregulated\u2014 one of her own. You could use this to get to the stars, easy. people would bow to you. You\u2019d be at her level. However This CORE is not yet complete. This CORE is the project of fifteen groups of people, just like you. Hundreds of thousands.. I\u2019ve lost count. There\u2019s too many. My days of fighting are over. I do not seek revenge. But you two\u2026 \u2026 Should you so desire, the next part of the CORE is located in the mountain. It is supplying a group of undead AI who named themselves \u201c The Datura .\u201d \u2026 If you must, I ask you proceed with caution. I don\u2019t want you to end up like everyone else. Gamma takes it at an almost comical speed. Honey laughs sadly. \u201cTo get up the mountain, you must go through hordes of CORES and AI. You have to travel through a forest which not even I have progressed.\u201d Gamma stops her. \u201cThen so be it! We don\u2019t make any difference here anyway!! We either live or live long enough to be killed, and if I even have the chance to make a difference, then why would I give that up?! I\u2019ll be killed, that\u2019s it. Yeah, I know! But, if I can at least\u2026\u201d Nea looks down, ashamed. Honey hesitates. \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see a passion much like yours anymore, much less in a clone .\u201d Gamma stands up. \u201cBeing a clone doesn\u2019t mean jackshit! If yer here ta just rail on me for bein\u2019 one, then\u2014!\u201d \u201cTch!\u201d Honey stands up and forces her down. \u201cAll this this and that that yer goin\u2019 on about! Calm down!\u201d Gamma and Nea glance at each other awkwardly. \u201cWhat I mean ,\u201d Honey says. \u201cIs you\u2019ve got a heart. Not a great thing, but not a bad thing, either.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d Honey rubs her temples. \u201cI.. You two..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 are absolutely insufferable!! \u201d Honey groans. \u201cPack up! We\u2019re leaving tomorrow!\u201d Nea stiffens. \u201cWh-what?!\u201d \u201cYou heard me! Hey, Han! Get \u2018em a room! Chasmus, take it outta my check. I got work ta do, go pack up an\u2019 get up!\u201d \u201cw-we already have a\u2014\u201d \u201cLOCK \u2018EM UP!!!\u201d \u2026 So Gamma and Nea sleep for the night, and are awoken at 3 AM by Honeycakes. \u201cc\u2019mon! this is baby work!\u201d Honey swings her hammer over her shoulder. \u201cY\u2019all are pathetic! Overthrowing a world leader and ya can\u2019t even get up? C\u2019mon!\u201d \u2026 And they go to the mountain. CTSNE of Honey breaking down the rusty gates leading up. Gamma laughs. \u201cDamn! we\u2019ve got nothin ta worry about, huh?\u201d She puts her arms behind her head. \u201cWith that , you can even rival Omega!\u201d \u201c\u2026 The one who beat up Pyrrhon?\u201d Gamma nods. Nea perks up. \u201cY-yeah! they were the same color as you, Gamma!\u201d \u201cGen 3 clone!\u201d Gamma puffs up her chest. \u201cWe\u2019re the last sentient clones around coz of him! Hah!\u201d Honey scratches the back of her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not something to brag about.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d Gamma says, \u201cWhat Division were you? I was 12.\u201d \u201cShut up!\u201d Honey says. \u201cWe\u2019re here to bash in skulls, not talk about your tragic backstory! Hurry up!!\u201d Stage 1 \u2014 Honey You play as Gamma and Nea for a bit until you get to a puzzle that only Honey can do. she chastises them and plows through it for them. You get to play as just her for the rest of the level, which isn\u2019t very much. Should be medium difficulty of more puzzles and exploration with minimal fighting until the end. Precision platforming Stage 2 \u2014 The Datura Small fighting sequence with the Datura AI. Gamma complains that they\u2019re stronger than usual and Honey snaps that it\u2019s the CORE. If it\u2019s the CORE you wanna get, it\u2019s the CORE you must defeat! This stage is more of a fighting stage than the last. After the first wave, you explore a small maze to heal, then fight a secondary wave. Stage 3 \u2014 Rattlesnake in the flowers Woah, the CORE is right there, unguarded! No, no it\u2019s not. Python\u2019s guarding it. Nea screams, exasperated. \u201cARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?\u201d Honeycakes grips her hammer. \u201cWe\u2019re going after her!\u201d The walls suddenly begin to close in (they\u2019re indoors) and it\u2019s a speed precision race to the end of the level. If you do a secret level you can get Gamma\u2019s motorcycle Stage 4 \u2014 Python RUH roh it\u2019s the Datura again!!! You bash in a round until you encounter Python. Insert conversation Python boss fight obtain bit of CORE! \u201cIs that it?\u201d Asks Gamma. Honey shakes her head. \u201cNope. That bitch ass cut it up. Looks like the Datura got some. Let\u2019s kill em!\u201d Stage 5 \u2014 Venom Python again :skull: Gamma says, \u201cLeave us alone! We don\u2019t want nothing with you!\u201d Python Points towards Honey: \u201cIt\u2019s not you two I want.\u201d Honey/Python conflict G: H-hold on! Honey can\u2019t\u2014.. That .. Omega\u2019s a clone! Honey-Honey.. she\u2019s\u2014 P: and how do you think she obtained such a high power weapon? She hasn\u2019t worked with the temples to obtain magic, right, Nea? N: \u2026 P: And Gamma, your fists, they\u2019re magic, aren\u2019t they? G: but\u2026 P: And what does that make you, Honeycakes? Non-religious magic possessor? H: \u2026 H: \u2026 H: \u2026 It\u2019s been a while, Python. G: Honey\u2014?! (Honey swings out her hammer) P: Ah? I save your life, and this is the thanks I get?! H: Tch! P: A murderer, that\u2019s what you always were! Just take out my CORE like you never even knew me in the first place! I dare you! P: and you.. you\u2019ve got a following, don\u2019t you now? P: Hah.. hahah\u2026 you\u2019re probably lying to them, too huh?! P: PATHETIC!! P: Come on, Honey! P: Life\u2019s just a game, right?! Isn\u2019t that what you told me?! P: SO WHAT\u2019S WRONG WITH FIGHTING TIL MY DEATH?!?! Battle start Something something. Fight her. Something else. Fight the Datura This is possibly the hardest fight here then. Well after that fiasco (survive long enough, lol. You can\u2019t defeat every single enemy, it\u2019s an endless wave until the timer runs out) and an unskippable death plays out. They are separated by Khan , with the last piece of the CORE, who comes to fully activate it. The blow upon activation is so insanely powerful that: Honey and Gamma are blown away Nea and Python are blown away. Chasmus is left alone. Stage 6 \u2014 Memory Cards Nea, Lane, Const, and Prodigal. Gamma and Nea wake up in a dingy alleyway in a common city. As they start to walk around, Nea gets a splitting headache and falls tot he ground. G: \u201cN\u2014.. Nea?! Are you okay?!\u201d N: \u201cGh .. damn\u2014.. damn fuckin\u2019 w.. ah..\u201d G: \u201c Oh.. Right, CORE density is much higher here.\u201d G: \u201cD-don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll.. I\u2019ll get you somewhere safe!!\u201d N: \u201cI-.. I\u2019m sorry..\u201d Gamma hefts Nea on her back Oh shit it\u2019s Lane and Prodigal!! Prodigal kidnaps gamma, and leaves Nea on the ground. Cue quickly moving stage with hard obstacles. After the stage, small cutscene of Nea spying on Prodigal and her group (Lock, Lane, and Conte) and dragging Gamma away like a spider in a web. Nea tries to sneak out, but is caught by Conte and Lock who do a combo attack and kick her out. Cue Constantine They catch her as she falls. They\u2019d gone to D4 for business, but for some reason caught a nerualink of Gamma and decided to come over. Constantine is here to deliver a USB of blackmail to someone in the underworld. \u201cWell, what are you guys wanting for?!\u201d Nea points towards the giant building Prodigal ran off to. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Gamma!\u201d This dungeon.. is incredibly long! 4 waves of enemies, and 2 waves of puzzle. The first puzzle wave is just for entering the building, the other one is for getting to the 4th wave and then Prodigal. 2nd wave is more complicated. Each wave includes a different challenge (ie consistent bleed, projectiles, immobilized, more projectiles but it\u2019s bigger). At the end, they get into a glass elevator and go up to the sky. You can vaguely see the conflict with Khan, Python, and Honey, but they pay it no mind. When you finish, cut to Gamma. You walk out of your cage, and into an eerily quiet hallway. You find yourself back in Future, trying to escape. It\u2019s actually almost impossible to lose here; you have almost infinite health and deal insane damage. Upon reaching the end, you fall down onto Earth, look up, and\u2014! Oh, it\u2019s just Prodigal. You\u2019re tied up against a wall and she\u2019s staring at you intently. A bad robotic voice asks, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d Prodigal slams her fist the wall beside Gamma. \u201cDo you remember? What we did?\u201d \u201cAll those years..\u201d \u201cDo you remember Who helped you escape from Future?\u201d Do you remember anything? Nea and Constantine break in from the ceiling and throw Lock and Conte off the sides. Prodigal tries to escape through the ceiling, but Honey throws her down. Constantine gets Gamma off of the wall and Shenx looks around. And shit goes down. It basically escalates to puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal \u2192 puzzle \u2192 Lane/Prodigal again, with Gamma 4life required. During the first puzzle, Lane says, \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her!!\u201d And once she is defeated, Prodigal takes her and runs away. During the second puzzle, Lane tries again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t take her away from me!!\u201d But she ends up falling to the ground. Prodigal asks one more time. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d Gamma slides back and spits blood onto the ground \u201cHell no!\u201d Prodigal jams her against the wall and presses her thumb into Gamma\u2019s forehead When Gamma fell in future, she saw Pyrrhon, who held a gun. She also saw Prodigal. She remembers prodigal. Flashbacks of how Prodigal helped her before, helped her fight, Pyrrhon says, \u201cnight night~\u201d And the video glitches to black. Prodigal asks. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d The conversation Gamma: \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Gamma: \u201cAre you pleased with yourself?\u201d Gamma: \u201cDo you enjoy killing everybody in sight? Do you get some sorta sick high off of seeing people scream and cry and\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d .. You win.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing I lost.. Everything..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. What\u2019s left of me?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI can\u2019t live knowing that she\u2014\u201c Prodigal: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cThe consequences are far too great for me to return home empty handed.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease allow me to have this one thing. The only freedom I\u2019ll ever get.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI lost.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win, okay?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou win.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d [Gamma\u2019s hands fall to her side]. Prodigal: \u201c.. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you can\u2019t- can\u2019t ever forgive me, but..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI have to thank you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI found you.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..?\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy sole reason for existence.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTo find you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma, you..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAs much as you hated me, I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t stand how they treated you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cYou remember, right? The cloning facility.\u201d Gamma: \u201c..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cA clone of my being..\u201d Prodigal: \u201d And yet, human despite it all.\u201d Prodigal: \u201d I couldn\u2019t let them take that away from you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cHahah. You ran away from me, didn\u2019t you? I was the reason you\u2019re here now with your scars and burnt edges.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cGamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI know you hated me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cBut I didn\u2019t hate you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just\u2014..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c(shiver, cough)\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI just really..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I can spend my last moments with you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy little sister..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cOhh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cH-hey\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cTake my CORE.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPut my metal carcass of a soul to good use, okay?\u201d Gamma: \u201cPuh..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProdigal, you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cPlease just\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201cProdigal, are you\u2014!?\u201d [Prodigal flops down on the floor]. Prodigal: \u201c.. Please.\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhat are you\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cShe took you away from me, and I\u2014\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. Your pitiful expression, that day..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIt was too much for me.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong for God to save me now.\u201d [Gamma grabs Prodigal\u2019s hand] Gamma: \u201cProdigal just\u2014!..\u201d Gamma: \u201cWhy\u2014.. Why couldn\u2019t you have\u2014?!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019ve done too much wrong.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Gamma: \u201cYOU IDIOT!\u201d [Gamma slams the ground] Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDN\u2019T YOU TELL ME?!\u201d Gamma: \u201cWHY DIDNT YOU\u2014?!\u201d (Gamma wipes away tears) Gamma: \u201cI.. I could\u2019ve saved you, Prodigal..! I-I thought that\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI never hated you.\u201d Gamma: \u201cI know. I know but why\u2014\u201c Gamma: \u201c.. Why coulnd\u2019t you have told me?\u201d Gamma: \u201cSo that I\u2014.\u201d Gamma: \u201c.. I wouldn\u2019t have\u2014!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cLook at you now.\u201d [Prodigal lifts a shaking hand onto Gamma\u2019s chest or hand] Prodigal: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d [Prodigal laughs quietly] Prodigal: \u201cOh, Gamma..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cIf only I\u2014..\u201d Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL!\u201d Prodigal: \u201cI\u2019m just glad I..\u201d Prodigal: \u201c.. can spend my last moments..\u201d Prodigal: \u201cwith you.\u201d Prodigal: \u201cMy baby sister..\u201d Gamma: \u201cProd-.. PRODIGAL?!\u201d Prodigal fucking SHOOTS herself Gamma: \u201cPRODIGAL! WAKE UP! PRODIGAL! PRODIGAL!\u201d [Gamma shakes Prodigal frantically, but her core flies out]. Prodigal faded away into the night, melting away with the distant summer sun. The only fading memory of Prodigal, her CORE, the very bane of her existence, rests in Gamma\u2019s bloodied hands. \u2026 Gamma equips Prodigal\u2019s CORE. \u2026 \u2026 Lane shows up beside Gamma, and stares at Prodigal\u2019s empty carcass. A slash, and Lane is also nothing but a desecrated corpse. \u2026 \u2026 Nea reconvenes with Gamma, who is still, and can\u2019t move. She hugs Gamma, who passes out upon touch. \u2026 \u2026 Honey\u2019s CORE is one half fuller. Prodigal had the third piece. \u2026 \u2026 Act 3: The Hive Crossing Over the Line Refresh your memory, or when you wanna be, the Phantom\u2019s on the way, She\u2019s coming down the street. Summer lights, seems to me, I\u2019m in a dream. This summer night\u2026 Huangzhi Khan, Python, Honey, Kai, and The Avatar . Back at the Slaughterhouse, Gamma\u2019s finally woken back up. She doesn\u2019t seem to feel like talking, but says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d anyway. the CORE\u2019s one half fuller. two more chunks to go. One is with Python, the other with someone else however, the conflict with Prodigal brought Honey\u2019s CORE to the attention of Pyrrhon, who set off after them. As they leave The Slaughterhouse, Gamma, Nea, and Honey are tracked down by police and chased. if you get caught it\u2019s a game over\u2014 you have to run to the next town over before they give up. This town is similar to a beehive. They throw a man to the ground as they go and he is shot down by police. Due to Honey\u2019s mass amount of strength, she is mistaken for a temple leader and is whisked away. Gamma and Nea are left alone. Follow Honey, she tries to fight but is put down by what looks like DGM CROW\u2019s talismans. Turns out the guy that they killed at the entrance was a high level temple leader\u2026 Nea has a panic attack as she realizes he died (shot by police). They currently mistake Honey to be that man. He didn\u2019t have a determinable gender so they just say she\u2019s a girl. she makes up a bullshit response which is obviously fake but fucking works anyway. You learn a small bit of her past through a flashback. Gamma and Nea sneak into her room via the window at the top of her ceiling. She\u2019s happy! At this time, you can now do side quests in this town. it\u2019s recommended you do at least one so you can unlock the inns and shops in this town. When they go outside, Honey sees Python. She summons her hammer ready to strike\u2014 She holds a small girl by her ponytail, and plugs the CORE into her. ??? \u201c\u2026 P\u2014.. Python..?\u201d P \u201cShh.. shh, you\u2019re still weak. Are you okay?\u201d ??? \u201cMy-my master, he\u2014..\u201d P \u201cshh.. it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll be okay.\u201d ??? \u201cP-Python, I\u2014.. I\u2019m so sorry, y-you..\u201d P \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. It wasn\u2019t that hard, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Python puts her injured arm behind her back and continues to stroke the girl\u2019s head. \u2026 \u2026 You can choose to still attack Python or not Attacked The bad ending. You strike, and Python flinches. You have struck the girl and killed her. Python stares at the girl in tears. H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201dYou-..\u201d H \u201c\u2026\u201d P \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Honey.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d \u201dI\u2019ll kill you.\u201d a DDLC esque glitch sequence sends Honey back to her room. Knock Knock Knock, Honey\u2019s woken up by guns. Gamma and Nea are nowhere to be found. She prioritizes herself and runs out of a really fucking dangerous dungeon outside of the town. She slips and falls suddenly, and someone puts their feet on her back. Huangzhi says, \u201cI got her. Take her in.\u201d The police show up, lead by Python. the CORE is implemented into her , embedded in to her back. \u201c\u2026 Police, dismiss. I will handle her.\u201d they disperse. \u201dThis is our fight, Honey.\u201d \u201dWill you fight me, or die like a dog?\u201d The hardest boss fight in the game starts here, lol. it\u2019s kind of impossible to win and it generally just encourages you to go show mercy to Python, the longer route. If you manage to beat her with just Honey on two lives, you wrench the CORE out of her back and kill her. Python is dead, but the CORE is 25% fuller. you return to the town like nothing happened. Mercy The good ending. You just get up and leave. Nearby guards ask Honey if she saw an intruder, but she declines. P. \u201c\u2026\u201d H. \u201c\u2026\u201d P. \u201cThanks.\u201d Python leaves with the girl. She leaves behind a really good weapon upgrader. Alright, so! You return back to your room. You might want to add more stuff in here. So you go into the hallway: Khan, and a few other people are there. While you try to refuse walking into the room, they refuse you.. haha. They talk to Honey and vaguely hint that they know who she is. When her fingers inch towards her Kendama, they tie her up immidletly and throw her at the bottom of an arena. Huangzhi sits there with Khan, twirling a key. \u201cGo.\u201d All of the NPCs from the town or temple attack you. When you get closer\u2026 Khan takes the CORE off of the pedestal, and then inserts it into a little boy. He attacks Honey. After winning (or, \u2018winning\u2019), Honey is thrown back and almost gets hit, until the attack is blocked\u2026 \u201cJust like old times, huh?\u201d It\u2019s Python! Similarly to the Ummu fight, she assists you. After the fight, there\u2019s a looong scene of an explosion. You seem to have won, the temple is in shambles, and no one can be seen. And then a missile is shot into Python\u2019s back. You have two seconds to press \u201cx\u201d to grab. if you don\u2019t, then the (INSERT GANG HERE) will attack you. if you do, they will stop and provide healing every now and then. That\u2019s the only difference it has. You catch a mild glimpse of PYRRHON. She saw you. She knows Honey runs with Python through the forest while being chased by Pyrrhon, who runs at lightspeed. Honey is thrown off of a cliff\u2014 She starts to fall, is this how it ends? I never even got to meet my mother, I never even got to.. I worked so hard.. is this the life I get? her hands are grabbed by Python, who\u2019s leaning off of a boat controlled by Gamma and Nea. She\u2019s hoisted onto the boat and runs off. As they hop back on land, the boat crashes but no one pays it any mind. A gang of bandits suddenly come out with knives. Gamma and Nea step forward to protect Honey. \u201cStand down\u201d, says Python. \u201cIt\u2019s solved.\u201d There\u2019s a group of groans and they all walk away. \u201cYou were going to AMBUSH me?!\u201d \u201cI DIDN\u2019T KNOW HOW YOU WERE GOING TO REACT!!\u2019 \u201cREACT TO WHAT?!?!?!?\u201d Gamma and Nea look at each other and sigh. Camera pan. Python sits atop the cliff, and gestures Khan away. Huangzhi later comes over, but he is thrown into the ocean. End of act 3. End of act three. Act 4: Late Loves Lamentations The world\u2019s on fire. After the HIVE, Nea and Gamma go to a nearby cave where they see Rhaika Lei making a campfire and meditating. You can rest with him. Upon interacting with him, he just opens one of his eyes, but says nothing, and goes back to normal. Behind him, there\u2019s a door you can go into. It\u2019s a gorgeous place, reminiscent of an old Catholic Church. At the center, there\u2019s a small statue and sword that is embedded into the chest of a small girl. It\u2019s a human girl. This is a cutscene. You can take it out, but Rhaika Lei will rush in and throw a dagger at your face. He doesn\u2019t talk again, but you do duke it out again. If you win, he staggers back. He chokes on his own words. You pull out the sword. \u201cWho dares disturb my slumber?\u201d Blah blah blah. Rhaika Lei spits out a black glob, which manifests itself into a spider and crawls into the statue. He starts coughing and sputtering. It\u2019s then that the statues eyes light up, and you\u2019re trapped in a dungeon, congrats. There\u2019s a broken fridge in there which flickers to life. You have to pay though. lol. Rhaika Lei is unconscious beside you, but he\u2019s holding a USB which you can insert into a cyborg. It details the tale of Kei, Kai, and Pyrrhon\u2019s conquest against God. It brings into question that there is more than known. Rhaika Lei snaps the USB out of you, then runs away. When you see him next, he\u2019s inserted it into an old mech, which he tries to use to fight you, but is stricken down by Kai, who descends down. \u201cThere is no need for your services, Rhaika Lei. You have done well. And you four\u2026 why have you summoned me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cYou expelled a curse for..?\u201d \u201cFor fun.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d Kai slumps down. \u201c\u2026 Do you need my help?\u201d \u201cYeah, wanna stop a world leader with us?\u201d Gamma jokes. Kai laughs and says sure. As the party member screen opens, it\u2019s cut in half. Kai is sputtering for breath. Her blood leaks into Rhaika Lei\u2019s dead corpse.","title":"I want"},{"location":"Notion/Previous%20Records/#prequel-story-lore","text":"(my first draft,, i lost the other one) XD It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Earth, in 2XXX. 2012, God fell from the heavens. Angels crashed and burned, and all left behind in the slaughter was a small, gleaning green gem. That\u2019s the PRODIGAL CORE, rumored to be the Core of life itself, the heart of God Himself. From the \u201crapture\u201d, as it was called, 75% of Earth was wiped out. 75% of Earth is \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d, and 25% is all under control of Pyrrhon . Pyrrhon\u2019s the maniacal maniac who harnessed the full power of the PRODIGAL CORE and brought Earth from the depths of hell: for a cost. All you need to know is now, Pyrrhon is in complete and total control of earth and its inhabitants. She runs \u201cOZ\u201d, the world IS OZ. There may be a government, but OZ holds so much power that they are completely powerless. Should OZ be brought down, so would the entire economy of the planet. Pyrrhon is a scientist, as mentioned. She and her friend, Reever, specifically had an interest in human experimentation. One of my many interests is human cloning! You might be able to see where this is going. All clones and nuclear experiments are done on small asteroid planets. One particularly noted is called FUTURE, where a lot of clones are produced. you might see the name \u201cGamma\u201d mentioned\u2014 she is a clone from here! In OZ, there\u2019s sub-categories. One of these sub categories is the NATIONAL GUARDIAN team. A national guardian is basically the only good job you can get without nepotism. On the outside, you fight. Defend the country. Become police, etc. that\u2019s it. Then you join the National guardian team. \u2014\u2014 It\u2019s a dingy night. A small boy named Marian, covered with scrapes and dirt, stumbles into a nearby town, gripping a scarf and a muddy medallion. Marian slides the medallion to an old woman, who gives him 3 months of shelter and a small wad of cash. A little less than expected, but good enough to last him a while. He stuffs it into his pockets and waddles over to a scruffy, orange-tinted man, holding a rusty tray of dry cupcakes. He sloshes over to him, kicking muddy water off of his dirty knees, and is handed a cupcake. The cupcakes, Marian would come to find, were salty, and not particularly good. But that didn\u2019t matter, none of it did. Marian holds a pen, trembling, grime and oil smearing on clean, crisp papers. He signs his name and soul and life away for admittedly too-salty cupcakes. Marian signs away to the National Guardian\u2014 a boy raised in a religious temple, who ran away to escape those higher than him. He is placed in a group with a grumpy old man as his leader, and another boy, named Khan. Khan has joined hte national guardian team to garner funds for his sister, who has unfortunately died before this point but now he can\u2019t really leave. It\u2019s here that they\u2019re given a CORE A CORE is something that a national guardian has. There\u2019s a rumor that Pyrrhon was the one who killed God and made the cores out of some of what she cut off of him. A CORE can be re used once a national guardian dies and placed into another, but what is it? A CORE with a peaceful owner does absolutely nothing. They will not advance, only live a normal life with above-average healing. With a CORE, you have a constant need for adrenaline, for hunger and power and action. Your CORE will level up from action and fighting, albeit extremely slowly. Even a NATIONAL GUARDIAN\u2019s whole lifetime can\u2019t get you to a good base level. Your CORE must be leveled up in order to be useful. You level up your CORE using other\u2019s CORES. CORES are found inside of every single genetically modified being. Including cyborgs, Prodigal Cores, Robots, Clones, etc. When that being is killed, it\u2019s absolutely mandatory you take out the CORE at the moment of death, otherwise the CORE will become useless, and the power will seep back into the Earth. You or the victim can take out the CORE. The CORE\u2019s energy is plugged into yours via included adapter, then it disintegrates, thus fully killing and ending the soul of that who used it. The CORE takes away your soul. Whether it be involuntarily inserted, your CORE is your soul. WIthout a CORE, you cease to exist. Now, in order to clone, you need eggs to produce them in. A girl named Chou is a donor, and has been for the past year or so. She\u2019s developed a platonic relationship with Khan, so he lives on for her. Anyway Anyway I forgot most of what happens in the prequel story, but blah blah blah immortality blah blah blah, Khan and Marian are homoerotic enemies blah blah blah Chou joins their team,here\u2019s where things get really bad. Pyrrhon has a strange fascination with Marian. Whether it be his hard head and big muscles or his strange moral compass, she loves him. And she can do whatever she wants with him. \u201cIt doesn't have to be human,\u201d says Pyrrhon, \u201cIt just has to be you .\u201d \u2026. On November 12, 2XXX, a child is born. That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates. He goes on his last mission with Khan and Chou, putting down a rebellion against Oz by a small group called The Last Hope, and Marian is so DONE. He gazes into Nea\u2019s eyes, He realizes that he really does love Nea. Marian refuses to fight from this point on. He gives his magically-infused scarf to Khan, a soft kiss, and then runs into the night. Khan can only stare in awe. Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He\u2019s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously). He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child. At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power. Nea could really care less. Until she walks into her room and sees her father\u2019s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman? \u201cMy daughter,\u201d she says to Nea. \u201cI found you.\u201d \u201dI am not your daughter.\u201d Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal. Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart. Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions. Nea looks up at Pyrrhon. Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires. Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter. Nea\u2019s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon\u2019s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon\u2019s smart. Why else is she a world leader? Her father lays motionless. Pyrrhon only grins. All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames. She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing. (first dra Pre-Established Basically, Khan and Marian were lumped in with this grumpy ass old man. I think Pyrrhon saw their backgrounds (Khan joined to get funds for his little sister, who was ill) and Marian ran away from his religious training and said \u201cfuck you brah\u201d so she put them with the worst possible guy. So this grumpy old man worked their asses off, to try to get into this huge competition in an arena, so that they\u2019d become National guardians. So they train and train and hate each other and love each other a little, and they end up winning that competition and make it into the national guardian association. Khan becomes kind of an egotistical BITCH at this time and leaves Marian who kind of set him up for the final blow which had them win. Marian sulks around, and he wanders back to his old hut with his master, and oh my god he\u2019s fuckign dead :sob: He doesn\u2019t even tell Khan, he just buries his master by himself. While in the forest, he meets this tiny little girl named Chou. She\u2019s bright blue (like gamma) and missing one eye. She\u2019s relaly, really scared like trembling shaking crying .. he feels pity for her and takes her to the infirmary. She actually thinks that Marian is Khan for some reason, but he doesn\u2019t say anything. Anyway, it turns out that Khan\u2019s sister actually fucking died a long time ago, so he took Chou under his wing to take care of. But since he\u2019s been too busy doing whatever shit he does, she\u2019s been lonely. Marian like an idiot, leaves her, and brawls with Marian for like, three hours. He does actually apologize and realize his wrongs, goes to Chou, and they both \u201cadopt\u201d her, basically. Chou is part of the genetic testing batch and was chosen to be a gene donor to some of the clones, so she\u2019s whisked away. They both stop by a bar and kinda go over what\u2019s happened to them so far. How far they\u2019ve come. How they\u2019re basically two halves of one whole already. Marian opens up about his past, and Khan about his. They forgive each other. Actually, before this time, Marian and Pyrrhon had their, uhm! Their run in. So, now they\u2019ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they\u2019re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it\u2019s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it\u2019s not within Pyrrhon\u2019s rules, it\u2019s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too. Anyway, they end up putting TLH to rest here, and Marian slams his sword down. \u201cI\u2019m done with this,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d Khan can\u2019t say much. He doesn\u2019t have much to say. He gets it, but, \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave us?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Marian. \u201cYou can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?\u201d \u201cBut\u2014\u201c \u201cBut what? We-we\u2019ll cook together and live together, and Chou\u2019ll be fine, and Pyrrhon\u2019s gonna leave us alone, and..\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cStupid, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019d say. But it can happen! I promise you.\u201d \u201cI\u2014..\u201d \u201c..\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t leave, Marian.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cBut I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.\u201d Khan wraps his scarf around Marian\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Marian.\u201d Marian smiles wistfully. \u201cI hope to see you again.\u201d (They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance. Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history. Marian joins a small temple in the middle of nowhere. Climbs up the ranks. brings Nea, who;d been born, with him. And Pyrrhon.. OLD DRAFT They\u2019re walking, when Nea is attacked by Khan. \u201cKill your father, burn his temple, then use his CORE for your own personal gain. Pathetic! Ungrateful brat!\u201d Cue fight sequence. Nea tells Gamma to stay out of this, so she does for the first half of the fight. Insanely hard fight against Khan. Heavyweight with lots of damage and knockback. More akin to the Filia/Fukua fight in Fukua\u2019s story mode. You have three tries until it skips for you. So, Nea\u2019s about to be stabbed, and then Gamma comes in and triple kicks him. There\u2019s a shorter fighting sequence where Gamma is stunning him here and there. Nea finally wins. \u201cTch. Fine, kill me. Rip out my heart and stab me, just like you did with Prodigal.\u201d \u201dA murderer. That\u2019s all you are. Lie and cheat and use everyone\u2019s demise to your own personal gain. Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. After Nea escapes from Future, she has a run in with some guy and Point helps her get a CORE outta one of the PiBots. So, she does that. Gamma comes along and screams, outta my way! She takes that CORE. Point tells Nea to get out. if you get out, you can\u2019t because Gamma challenges you and is like \u201cIzzat point? Goddamn! He really won\u2019t leave me alone.\u201d \u201cFive second rule, yk? Gotta get it fresh.\u201d She jams your transmissions and then you fight. The same thing happens if you walk towards her, just with different intro dialogue. *YOU CAN ONLY DEFEAT GAMMA USING A BLOCKBUSTER, or whatever the equal is. It\u2019s because she\u2019s metal and she\u2019s weak to Magic. Dream magic and reg Magic should be a thing. Nea uses Dream Magic She gives up after the first hit from the blockbuxaster and then Gamma just leaves because her pride is hurt. She throws you the CORE and hops away. Okay so you leave into the forest and then uh oh, it\u2019s Gamma. She staggers towards you and begs for a truce. She even gives you her powerbank, which she\u2019s using to power her PiCORE, since she has no external energy to grab. You guys can talk. You can ask her how she knows Point, or who she is. She dances around answering about Point, but they were in the resistance before together :) they tried getting together, and actually kissed! But Gamma is a lesbian (point is gay too) so they don\u2019t really like each other, but they\u2019re just too embarrassed. They kissed before the resistance force shelter was bombed. OH OH SHE ASKS YOU ABOUT where you\u2019re from! \u201cThe over world..? I guess that explains things.. You know, like why you have an abundance of magic and no idea how to use it. Haha, sorry! Sorry!\u201d She gets all sentimental on you. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like? I hear it\u2019s being overrun by politicians right now\u2026 Oh, really? There\u2019s really no safe space on Earth anymore, huh?\u201d \u201cYou need to talk to Point? .. Oh.\u201d She gives you her powerbank (like just shoves it in her hands), stating that she doesn\u2019t need it anymore. She needs it to fight, but she says that it\u2019s getting harder to fight. It\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m so tired.. Gamma suddenly collapses. A small hologram states that she\u2019s very low on power. Nea just tucks Gamma into the bed next to her. The powerbank and her transmitter are on the side, she hasn\u2019t used it yet. She kinda thKhans about it, before drifting off to sleep\u2026 HOLY FUCK ITS PRODIGAL Prodigal comes along and fucking BURNS the forest down. Nea slams the powerbank back into Gamma, who gets up. She\u2019s stuck in her PiBot mode since Nea is bad with computers. Gamma scares Prodigal off, and then there\u2019s a shot of her amidst the fire, and looking back, like the eclair cyborg picture I had. She extends a hand, and they fly off. You can either get Nea\u2019s route maybe or you can get Tsao and Khan maybe.. Pre-DEMOlition Bijyun opening: A few glitches in the opener when you log in and when you immediately leave afterward. Gamestyle: A short hack-n-slash tutorial. Quick-paced and gets you over the basics, which include: Grappling hooks Basic movement controls Extremely basic fighting controls + crouch/crouch attacks Not too long for the tut sequence, but a little longer for the fighting sequence. \u201cWhew! You okay there, Gamma? Back on track, \u2018Kay? Get going!\u201d Afterward, you get a semi-glitched cutscene, and Gamma falls to the ground. Guess what happened here? Pyrrhon glitched Gamma\u2019s memories! All glitching is actually the memories she had with Prodigal She lands in Marian\u2019s abandoned temple with her motorcycle, the Comet. Cut to Gamma at her new job. \u201c\u2026 And now I\u2019m here. Working under the same person, same conditions, just somewhere else.\u201d A testing sequence, 1v1 battle against a harder foe + a few troop waves. As she tosses it up into the air (carelessly), it\u2019s shot out of her hands and Prodigal fucking eats it. Anim.cut where Gamma loses her job. She\u2019s pretty unreliable anyway. \u201cBut I\u2014!\u201d \u201cOn , you failed to retrieve \u2019s heart\u201d On ___ you took Lock\u2019s left lung for your own personal gain\u201d Etc. it\u2019s actually extremely funny how unreliable she is. They throw her over the side of the fucking building because she gets into a fight She lands, hard. She\u2019s gasping for air, but somehow still clinging onto the life she once had. \u2026 and then Nea falls next to her. She isn\u2019t in as much pain as Gamma, but that throw was supposed to kill, so thank God for Gamma being there to break her fall. \u201c\u2026 Got fired too?\u201d Says Gamma. Nea gasps for air. \u201c\u2026 yeah.\u201d They just kind of, sit there. It\u2019s raining, they\u2019re basically going to die. There\u2019s nowhere to go. They\u2019re both bleeding out into each other. That\u2019s what Nea says, at least. Gamma tries to keep them both awake, but they both end up collapsing from blood loss. Potential Shenx meeting instead of Huangzhi, who takes them both and says \u201chey Prodigal is being really mean to us and we need you guys to take her out.\u201d Gamma was an experiment to make a clone as \u2018human\u2019 as possible. Prodigal was the second part to make the clone as robotic as possible. With this, they studied how they fared in battle situations. Prodigal was genuinely fucking FASCINATED with Gamma, like obsessively, and stalked her around. Gamma really hated Prodigal for that. Actually, Gamma was barely aware of Prodi\u2019s existence. Pyrrhon did everything in her power to keep them separated. This is where the \u201cProdigal Boss\u201d Lore comes into play. She finds Gamma with Nea, who she sort of just observes from a distance. Think Hornet, from Hollow Knight, or Road, from D. Gray-Man. Yes, she causes all sorts of issues, but they never come face to face. But tensions build. At the end of a chase scene, Nea stabs down Prodigal. Prodigal doesn\u2019t even fight, and only falls limply to the ground.

Use your father\u2019s sword to kill his last remaining memory.\u201d Nea\u2019s sword pierces through his skin and scratches his CORE. \u201cI\u2019m more mature than that, you know.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t kill you. But I do want to know some things.\u201d \u201cLike hell I\u2019d\u2014\u201c \u201cHow do you know my father?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d Well, nothing big comes out of that, but Gamma gets kidnapped and Nea is paralyzed with him for a while. Thank you, Pyrrhon\u2019s public safety detection system. They both silently forgive each other. If you go to a hotel, you get this special dialogue: \u201cWe need to get Gamma, but we need to recover before that.\u201d \u201cHey! Get your own room, old man!! Ugh! You sicken me.\u201d \u201cYou think I\u2019d want to be on the same floor as you?! Tch, I don\u2019t need your money! I get a discount, anyway!\u201d \u201cHah? What, a senior citizen discount?\u201d \u201c\u2026 I get two discounts.\u201d (huh!) \u201c..You know, you\u2019re surprisingly fit..\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201c.. For a FOSSIL.\u201d Khan flinches back at her. She only smiles. Screen fade to black. Nea stumbles into her room with a bump on her head, laughing. Khan stumbles into his room with a cut on his cheek. He isn\u2019t too happy. The next morning, Nea\u2019s already up and packing. Khan walks down the stairs with a coffee and an already-packed duffel bag. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Gamma. Stay here.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t lose her\u2026\u201d \u201c?\u201d \u201cJust like I lost him.\u201d \u201cHow would I be able to trust you? You don\u2019t even know her.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me. Be mature about this.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cFine. Let\u2019s go. But if you even lay a hand on her, or if you attack me, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201c You think I\u2019d do that? I need information outta you too. Shut up and get moving.\u201d They both go through a small dungeon, bickering and fighting along the way. Khan has very high base stats but he\u2019s very hard to use. He\u2019s at a higher level than the average Nea/Gamma level. Keep it a set level. He\u2019s not great with comboing but you can chain attacks (think of Parasoul\u2019s tear mechanic or a little bit of Otsukin\u2019s chains or valentine\u2019s vials). Alt Khan can\u2019t actually help you </3 This dungeon is VERY short, so it takes up the time frame of one level, which is like 15 minutes with a lot of rooms. It\u2019s just an aoe fun run. They get to the end, and holy shit Gamma isn\u2019t there. Actually, no one\u2019s there. It looks like she broke out of the wall. Nea and Khan get surrounded. Meanwhile, with Gamma.. Running through the forest. She ate a mysterious fruit (tomato) earlier, and is beginning to choke. She\u2019s not allergic\u2014 did you know thai8t Clones have extremely strict dietary restrictions? Ref to the acid reflux. Someone (who is a little easily seen from the background) hops out and basically like, fucking guts her. I\u2019m kidding. What she does is open the latch on her stomach which pours out some of the stomach acid. Gamma shakily gets up. \u201c\u2026 wh-who..?!\u201d \u201cYer lucky you\u2019re a gen 3 clone. Any higher an\u2019 ya would\u2019ve died already.\u201d Gamma\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re a c\u2014!!\u201d \u201cSame batch as you. Humanities, Div 3. Pleased to meetcha.\u201d Honey shakes her hand. \u201cYou can call me Honey. \u2018S what my friend calls me. Any other name an\u2019 I gut ya you for parts, \u2018Kay?\u201d \u201c\u2026 Gamma.\u201d \u201cA pleasure. Where ya headed?\u201d \u201cUhm\u2026\u201d The story so far is explained with a fade to black. Honey puts her hands behind her back. \u201cYou wanna find \u2018em?\u201d Gamma nods. \u201cSaw sum suspicious figures while I was fishin\u2019. Old fart and bratty monk.\u201d \u201cMonk?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got the marking\u2019s of one. Star an\u2019 refined magic an everything. \u201c\u2026 Huh.\u201d \u201cProlly resigned if she\u2019s talkin with you. | Ah, look at that. We\u2019re here.\u201d (Opening to the new island, the one where Honey and Constantine are. The one that\u2019s a Baguio/Bontoc replica). \u201cBut-but\u2014!\u201d \u201cShh. Yer injured. I\u2019ve adopted you. I\u2019m obligated to.\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cWhat, wanna go fight?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t just leave them!\u201d Honey kind of stares at her for a second, and then punches her. She flies across the map and ragdoll collides with the window barriers. Very loose physics. \u201cIf you can\u2019t even beat me, how do you expect to save your friends?\u201d \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cSee? Okay. I get a discount, since my girlfriend works there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Khan and Nea are tied up and about to be thrown into the incinerator. Khan says something about her father, and then\u2014! \u201cI\u2019m glad it was me and not her,\u201d says Nea. \u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t see me like this,\u201d says Khan, to Marian (depending on who you\u2019re playing as). Honey and Gamma show up, and you do an equally fun aoe damage dungeon with them instead. Khan and Honey give each other glares at the end but Nea and Gamma are happy to see each other again. \u201cSo, now what?\u201d Gamma and Nea sit at the edge of the cliff and point towards Pyrrhon\u2019s empire in the distant summer sunset. \u201cThere.\u201d Cool perspective shot of all of them, then the chapter ends. One Shots and Whatnot Species Chibao (Khan, Clementine, and Rhaikha-Lei). ChiBao\u2019s live for a very long time, they\u2019re like the elf equivalent in CORE. It is a male dominated culture, with women being very rare and held at utmost care. When you think of magic capabilities, these are the ones you think of. These are the pioneers of magic creation, even the controversial refined magic. From the start to the end, magic has run through the veins of the ChiBao. Stats They tend to lean towards speed and offense with low Defense and HP. This is because they don\u2019t usually get hit in general and use ranged attacks most often. This can vary between personalities. Physical Appearances Easily defined by their slender figures and pure white eyes, the ChiBao originated as a small tribe around Southeast Asia. They wear makeup made of ashes around their eyes. On occasion, they will wear the ashes of their enemies when going into war. Traditional clothing includes long, flowing hair (typically braids) and long scarves or other forms of clothing. This symbolizes their long lives. Due to their environment, their colors are usually warm/brownish colors. Their hands are absurdly large and calloused. They don\u2019t shave off their callouses, since it serves as a natural protection against their strong magic. History The ChiBao are credited for the first recordings of asexual reproduction that wasn\u2019t cloning. This was later tabooed. Their cells are completely incompatible with other species, so they can\u2019t have other mixes of children. They eat the other ones up like acid. Consequently, there are very little ChiBao in existence today, so they\u2019re held in generally high regard. They are a very \u2018purist\u2019 tribe, since they are physically incapable of mixing with other species. Their religion, however, is open to any species, gender, and color. Chiru (Nea, Chasmus, Marian, and Shenx). More magic-oriented than Inozha, but much less than the ChiBao. The \u2018unicorns\u2019 of CORE. They are so widespread, that there is no one tradition that the Chiru adapt. They instead adapt of wherever they are staying in. The most average of all the species. Stats It varies between personality, but they tend to lean more towards offense OR defense. There is not one or the other. They tend to use short-ranged attacks due to their size. Physical appearance It\u2019s very common for them to be short and stubby legged, but a few have had absurd growth spurts which boost them to normal height. Since their legs are abnormal, they are prone to injury. Many people have surgery or \u2018splints\u2019 inserted into their legs, like Huangzhi. Nea simply doesn\u2019t run very often for this fact. They have a lot of color variation, but go more towards cool, dark colors. Chiru are known for having the fastest hair growth out of anyone else. History They originally began as a small nomad tribe who picked up various other wanderers of other cultures and species. Because of this.. cesspool, they eventually grew strong together and took over large parts of the Earth. they are so widespread that there is no stereotype that could fit any of them. Inozha (Constantine, Shou, Pyrrhon, Han, Hal, Clementine, and Coda) The secondary average tribe, but with no magic. Absolutely none. The \u2018red blooded Americans\u2019. Also extremely widespread, but stereotyped to be big, burly, and aggressive. The \u201cearth ponies\u201d. stats Extreme offense! It\u2019s very, very rare for them ever to rely on anything else! Brute force, amiriight?! Physical Appearance Extreme color variety, from skin color to colors. These are the species that popularized clothing. Very fashionable and adaptable. They have small bodies but are extremely quick and powerful. history They came in very late to the whole Stickfigure sub species scene, and when they did, they brought up the Industrial Revolution. They brought clothes, colonization, money, technology, etc to both magic oriented tribes. Because of their alliance with the Chiru, Chiru lost touch of their extreme magic capabilities over time. The Inozha are heavily credited towards .. capitalism and business. Nai (Honey, Gamma, Kei, Kai, Prodigal, Python, Huangzhi, and Chou). A simple term used to describe those who don\u2019t fall into any of those categories. Everyone in here is mostly a clone.","title":"Prequel Story + LORE"}]}
