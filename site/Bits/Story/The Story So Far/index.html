<p>The human race has gone extinct.<br />
From greed came war, and from war came disease.<br />
Animals began to mutate into grotesque creatures, which would die from their own overgrowth. Plants would develop their own sentience, teeth and organs. The disease would eat the very cells in the human body.<br />
The only things left were the Rumors which crawled the Earth. And from the ashes, they grew into a thriving species of vaguely humanoid figures.<br />
They’d built a society over time, shockingly similar to the human races. From artifacts, they deciphered languages. From abandoned buildings came flourishing cities. Art was re-learned, computers were re-invented, and wars were re-fought.<br />
In 1981, Beau would come into rule, bringing with him a new innovative age of technology, automation, and a capitalistic hell. Historians call it the Beginning of the End.<br />
The Beau line would slowly devolve into capitalistic tyranny, all the way until 2012, when God Himself fell from the heavens.<br />
The rapture had begun.<br />
Angels crashed and burned, volcanoes erupted and the Earth trembled in it’s wake, bringing with it a cold and bitter wind. Historians estimate that 75% of the world was entirely wiped.<br />
As the dust clears, a pulsating, white CORE rest in a small mount of cotton.<br />
The PRODIGAL CORE was rumored to be the Core of Life, the Heart of God.<br />
It’s the ultimate mother’s womb, it has the ability to breathe the breath of life into any creature given to it. The last living ruler of Beau’s ancestral line, Adonis, kept everything under a tight fist. The hierarchical system was worse than ever, with the divide from rich and poor growing ever larger.<br />
A young scientist began wandering around the Earth, developing her own small, anarchy-run town. Due to its success and stability, and also the sudden boom of population, she decided to kill Adonis.<br />
That scientist, Pyrrhon, and a group of her friends snuck behind the exhausted guards and stabbed Adonis in the back of the neck. This began Pyrrhon’s Golden Rule.<br />
She rebuilt society entirely, for a short while. She used her knowledge and empathy to grow and enhance the arts and scientific progression. Diseases died out by the hundreds each year. Incurable defects could now be treated. Nothing was chronic, not under her watch.<br />
Everything seemed fine.<br />
And then Pyrrhon actually realized what being ruler meant. Everything has since been stuffed under the rug.<br />
Pyrrhon killed her parents and used her money to sneak it under the rug.<br />
To her partners which had found it unethical, she killed them too.<br />
She began to become generally.. extremely mentally unstable at this time. lol. With that, she began conquering the other small countries around her which established sovereignty upon her beginning.<br />
Also, she started living suspiciously long, and looked suspiciously long, for a 200 year old woman. She looked like the thriving 20-something she always had been.<br />
Pyrrhon enacted the National Guardian Security system, which would put everyone in poorer families to work, specifically ones she didn’t like.<br />
(Marian and Khan were born at this time).<br />
With each cured disease came three more unethical experiments done on other people. With each treated defect came a new country devoured under her reign, until everything was run by one person.<br />
Pyrrhon.<br />
From her goal of reversing Beau’s tyranny, she had become even worse.<br />
It was also then, that Pyrrhon had made the biggest scientific breakthrough in all of history: the secrets of Immortality and her infamous ‘clone army’.<br />
This marked the years until now as “The Age of Eugenics”, because that’s what it was and still is.<br />
And everything’s crumbling, all the same.<br />
Will another leader repeat the cycle, or will the Earh crumble into its long awaited demise?…<br />
Pyrrhon and Kei<br />
She found Kai’s counterpart, Kei, inside of God’s heart. Kei is the last living human, ever. She’s managed to keep her frozen in time using a mixture of her own methods and God’s magic.<br />
Using Kei and Chou (the genetically perfect being), she plans to repopulate the Earth with clones where no one can be sad and where everything is under her control to prevent every single war. To prevent any differneciality, to prevent any destructions, to prevent anything from ever going wrong. If everyone is the same, then nothing bad will happen, and she will do that using Kei.<br />
This Earth is just an experiment. She inserted a single Kei gene which didn’t reproduce nor destroy into PRODIGAL. She chose her because prodigal was so fuckign corrupted that the Kei gene didnt eat away at her, but also didn’t repopulate itself. However it was kind of an infinite energy source so Prodigal was able to wreck mass havoc on society (If we continue using Balach as a story element, he is the reason Prodigal was unleashed. Because in a very VERY old version, Shenx had sealed her away in a forest).<br />
But by this Earth being an experiment, she’s testing what genetic effects work, better brainwashing techniques, basically developing the clones into perfection. Also she’s going to wipe out everyone and repopulate it with just the clones and Kei.<br />
Prodigal only had the Kei gene inserted once Gamma escaped, so she was still able to be conscious because she wanted to find Gamma.<br />
Pyrrhon’s obsession with Marian came from Kei glancing in his direction. The reason she did was because she liked his bright hair tie. Pyrrhon saw this as a prophecy. She woudl be a Scientologist probaby/<br />
Pyrrhon, as a child, was relatively ignored. Her real name is unknown<br />
She had three older brothers and two parents. Two older brothers have moved to get higher education, but the third stayed in the nearby area since he got accepted into the aerospace industry.<br />
Pyrrhon, initially, wasn't super great at school, but her brother took her into his aerospace workplace and she tell in love. She got insane results and actually graduated college early to get that job with him.<br />
(Her parents neglected her a lot. No matter what she did, she couldn't do it).<br />
So after about a year, they plan to send her brother to space, since he's very physically active and good at this stuff.<br />
That day was November 10, 203 BFC.<br />
God's CORE fell to the ground and intercepted her brother. He died as God came down from heaven.<br />
All that was left was the CORE, which had landed right in her hands.<br />
So she got to work, and built her empire.<br />
Her parents took credit for her work, so she killed them and used them for experimentation. It's the first time she realized that she has that power, and then, discovered the work of early human eugenics, and, with the CORE, set out to create the perfect society to erase all pain.<br />
and so..<br />
Marian is not a very good person to be honest, and never was. His origin story lands himself as.. well, he ran away from home because he hates religion, joined the army, became even worse, and got worse.<br />
He joins the army at 13, not because he supports Pyrrhon but because he just hates his church. He doesn’t really know what he’s been getting into, but at least he got a cupcake for registering. However the person who made them mistook the sugar for salt and so it’s incredibly salty.<br />
Marian trains with Khan and this crippling old man who is not FLLFFL because FL is a nice person, and his mentor is a piece of absolute dogshit.<br />
Um POTENETIAL SPOILERS: If we go with the “Pyrrhon is self aware she is in the game and hacks into the games code to give herself immortality and such”, then their master has also discovered immortality, BUT was later assasinated by Pyrrhon because he was a threat.<br />
Him and Khan have an odd homoerotic relationship. Khan joined the army for a noble cause, and they both detest each other because:<br />
Marian: Khan is an egotistical, stupid, know-it-all bastard! He thinks he’s sooooo great!!!<br />
Khan: Marian is a disgrace who brings SHAME upon our entire species! I’m embarrassed to have to share a PLANET with him! He is so selfish and uncouth, what a brat!<br />
Their master likes to joke around and tell them, “just fuck already” which they both genuinely do hate, but theyre both so unsocialized they do .. um, nefarious activities with each other as teenagers.<br />
At ~age 16, they get into their first mission, which is with Padme and Uche to stop a horde of rouge clones on the Phisit mountains. I have the mission planed out and the entire prequel story is either going to be an RPG, book, or a DLC addition. But anyway the mission was a death mission in disguise, but they were able to do it so well that.. well, it worked out! And they made quite a name for themselves<br />
Fast forward a few missions later, Padme and Uche were sent away to an overseas mission where they were later reported as dead. This is where the beginning of the end starts.<br />
While leaving from a particularly rough mission, Marian and Khan head to a bar. As they’re there, they spot Chou (you can read more information about her on her wiki page) and recruit her because shes a perfect genetic being.<br />
Blah blah blah stuff happens here, Marian has his epiphany and becomes a better person through Chou and finally discovering empathy for other people. Khan has the opposite effect where he loses his morality and becomes a selfish brat, like how Marian was at the beginning of the story.<br />
Ok, Khan joined the army initially to get funding to save his little sister. He’s the second youngest out of 16 siblings, and his younger sibling is very very sick. While he did obtain the money, when he sent it she was already dead.. she died right after he left.<br />
So he’s quite distraught. And Chou looks.. way too similar to his sister..<br />
He doesn’t do anything necessarily bad to Chou, but he just forgets about her Marian and what brought him to his current state of power. Et cetera. I dont want to talk about this portion of the story s ince Its my weakest point.<br />
However, Chou almost dies because Khan decides to be an asshole and stupid, and Marian fights basically to the death to save her. He’s had enough of Khan’s bullshit and it ends up resulting in this HUGE fight with the two of them where they’re both gravely injured.<br />
By this point, Pyrrhon has caught notice of Marian. She’s in a big less power than she is now, since this was ~70 years ago.<br />
Pyrrhon calls Marian up to her office. She’s fascinated by him. Maybe it’s his absolute lack of a moral compass or his fighting prowess, but no matter.<br />
Now, Pyrrhon’s all powerful, and her obsession with Kei has caused her to slip, and she can do whatever she wants with him…<br />
“It doesn’t even have to be human,” says Pyrrhon. “It just has to be you.”<br />
That child is named Nea, whom Marian really really hates.<br />
After he was released from being tortured by Pyrrhon and Mutilaiton, he went to that same bar he met Chou at<br />
Consequentially, Khan is also at that same bar.<br />
They talk<br />
Reminisce<br />
Remind themselves<br />
Of who they were in the past.<br />
No one believes Marian about Pyrrhon and Nea. But Khan does.<br />
Anyway it’s a bit icky here. TW for more dubious activities. Marian is traumatized and extremely mentally unstable. So is Khan but he’s started to chill out after the whole Chou ordeal. He feels a responsibility to help out Marian since he’s going through so much. Marian is really hyper sexual after being raped, basically, by Pyrrhon and Khan has to deal with the brunt of that. He doesn’t know if he likes Marian, but .. it does feel nice. But, does it really? he feels a responsibility to bear the cross with Marian. Is it not his fault that this occurred..?<br />
So, now they’ve been sent on a mission to put down TLH. Since they’re in a group, Chou was conveniently placed with them. They go to a small town. Since it’s small and not regulated by Pyrrhon’s rules, Marian buys Khan a cloak infused with magic which would usually be illegal, but since it’s not within Pyrrhon’s rules, it’s not. Khan gifts Marian a nose flute. It has magic too.<br />
And so, Marian went on a mission (his last mission). He took her, Khan, and Chou with him to finish up the mission. The mission was to basically put down a rebellion/rebel group named “The Last Hope”.<br />
Now, Shenx.. His parents were DEEPLY involved in TLH, and so was he. He was a fierce warrior even at like. Age ten. So of course he fought with them!<br />
Khan was filled with rage. Fueled by his own bloodlust and his rage from Chou, from Pyrrhon, from Marian, from what he loved about Marian, what he hated about himself. With that, he slaughtered the entire division by himself. Still in his bloody high, he slashes at a nearby ten-year-old child, leaving a huge gash in the middle of his chest. He slices off his legs, one by one. He runs his sword along Shenx’s arms shoulders, running the blade in-between his shoulder sockets, watching the blood dribble along the blade, into the sweet, sweet Earth, and—<br />
Marian slams his sword down. “I’m done with this,” he says. “I can’t do this anymore.”<br />
Khan can’t say much. He doesn’t have much to say. He gets it, but, “You’re going to leave us?”<br />
“I don’t have to,” says Marian. “You can come with me! Y-you and Chou! And we-we can build a temple, and we can.. we can just live, you know? Both of us! Like normal guys! Y-you know?”<br />
“But—“<br />
“But what? We-we’ll cook together and live together, and Chou’ll be fine, and Pyrrhon’s gonna leave us alone, and..”<br />
“…”<br />
“…”<br />
“Stupid, isn’t it? That’s what you’d say. But it can happen! I promise you.”<br />
“I—..”<br />
“..”<br />
“I can’t leave, Marian.”<br />
“…”<br />
“But I respect your decision. I wish you the best of luck.” Khan wraps his scarf around Marian’s neck. “I’ll miss you, Marian.”<br />
Marian smiles wistfully. “I hope to see you again.”<br />
(They kiss) And Marian trudges off to the distance.<br />
Khan reports that Marian died in combat. Chou says nothing. and the rest is history.<br />
Marian is later found, frost-bitten and bleeding in front of a temple in the middle of the Forrest, clutching a small baby girl. He’s taken in, only because of Nea, and he rebuilds his life as a religious leader (apart from the one he was in previously).<br />
He remains a pacifist, and Nea grows as a relatively stable, but a little strange child.<br />
At age 18, a woman in violet and black robes waltzes into the lobby. Recognized as Pyrrhon, world leader. War leader. The only person in power and the only person to remain in power.<br />
Nea could really care less.<br />
Until she walks into her room and sees her father’s corpse, mangled and burnt. And who else to stand above it but that woman?<br />
“My daughter,” she says to Nea. “I found you.”<br />
“I am not your daughter.”<br />
Her father coughs up blood. Marian, renowned warrior, accomplished magician. Cowering at her feet like an animal.<br />
Marian reaches into the depths of his chest, and out comes a beating heart.<br />
Not a heart, a CORE. A machine of dreams and delusions.<br />
Nea looks up at Pyrrhon.<br />
Nea equips the heart of her father, soaked with blood and gore and fat and wires.<br />
Pyrrhon looks down at her daughter.<br />
Nea’s a skilled swordsman. Launching forward in a flurry of attacks, but not enough! Pyrrhon’s quick on her feet, Pyrrhon’s smart. Why else is she a world leader?<br />
Her father lays motionless.<br />
Pyrrhon only grins.<br />
All Nea remembers from that day is running out of the temple, now in flames. Centuries of history and dreams of the unknown, all dancing in the wind with the flames. The last remnants of human history, gone.<br />
She looks down at her fingers, burning with flames.<br />
She looks up at the temple again, and feels nothing.<br />
Five years later, no one knows it was her. Not that many people knew that temples still existed, anyway. Much less that one burned down in the middle of nowhere.<br />
She attends schools and colleges, since what else could you do? But slave away her magic for a machine which rejected the very idea of her? Nea only bites her teeth and steels herself. No point in fighting a losing battle.<br />
Nea as a child,,<br />
She’s like, Really self-centered and quite manipulative, she used her looks and good reputation to gain attention from people around her to give her stuff. She bought a lot of stupid items. She was particularly good at love bombing and gaslighting She was okay at school, for a time. She had a small phase where she rebelled (they had the money to just stop..) and dropped out of school for a while to do random shit, like sports. But her dad forced her back in. Even as a kid, she was really loud. She didn’t cry but she wailed, and she wailed a lot. She was a stubborn little brat who always wanted her way. Quite literally no empathy for other people, she was one of THOSE popular kids. Nea was taken out of her last two years of middle school to do intensive temple training, which actually brought her back into shape and she became a little less spoiled. She became good at fighting and was now really educated in religion and everything because she literally worked her ASS off (out of complete spite, there was another girl she didn’t like in her program). Her dad congratulated her, which gave her the confidence to start trying in school. In high school, she was like twilight sparkle but more sociable.<br />
She was “popular”, but mostly because the popular kids there liked her because she’d let them cheat off her homework. She went to the same school Regina went to, fun fact. Anyway, she ended up getting a boyfriend. She thought that she could easily take advantage of his new money for her own advantage, but no! Nea actually got uh, into a very bad and toxic relationship! I mean, sure, she had “relationships” but none of those guys could really “handle her” (poor and she was really energetic and got too excited a lot). He kinda, like, used her for her body and turned all of her previous manipulation tactics against her, so she was in a terrible state until she was taken out AGAIN for more religious training, which she was pretty happy to do. So for three years, she didn’t step foot outside of her temple. She was in a pretty nasty mental state, and it’s not like her dad really helped her with that. Marian doesn’t know how to deal with kids so he’s kinda emotionally neglectful and lashes out at them a lot. He’s actually a little abusive, so Nea had a bad relationship with him. He also hated her because of what happened with Pyrrhon, but he was getting better slowly and was now (badly) trying to spark a relationship with her. However she rejected 99% of attempts (except one, which was near the end). So she mastered the art of Refined Magic, good job, Nea!<br />
By this time, she’d graduated high school solely off of religious exemption and now worked at her temple for one more year, until Pyrrhon invaded it, and then she burned the temple down,, Mostly because she had almost never suffered the consequences of her own actions before. Anything broken could always be replaced with her money, but her father is gone, and years of history is now ash, and Pyrrhon’s after her, and she’s completely useless now. She never talked about her religious background, but bought herself a fake identity after working a year or so in the underworld. She went to school for engineering and minored in music while working her side job in the underworld, But like, she got fired.. and like, she met Gamma.. and like, got kicked out of school because she’s rumored to be dead.. After Marian’s death she became really quiet and completely reconstructed herself as a being. She’s also really NARCISITIC STILL HONESTLY FUCKING LEARN!!! But she leans on the independent, “I’m better than you and you will taint me by your presence!”<br />
Ermmm tl;dr when Marian was taking Nea through the snow, her heart became extremely weak and damaged so she does canonically have a mechanical heart because it can’t beat on its own She also has re-enforced legs to help her stand on her own, otherwise she’d be crippled<br />
And anyway, remember Shenx?<br />
So Shenx’s whole mission is fueled by revenge to kill Khan, and consequently Pyrrhon’s empire. He built his mech out of the remains of what was left in TLH and the dead clones that his parents killed. And went to the underground..<br />
People generally respected this 12 year old boy walking in with no legs and a mech doing all sorts of crazy shit. He met lots of good friends (one in particular named Sho) and managed to scrape together enough money and people to revive TLH. It’s an underground operation still, but they do operate.<br />
Tl;dr shenx is mad at Khan for cutting his legs off, revives a rebellion group out of spite.<br />
Right now they operate out of his bar, The Slaughterhouse. Sho works there as a chef. Shes unironically good at her job, she just hates talking to people. When you talk to her in game, it takes of -1 HP.TLH has actually made some progress dismantling Pyrrhon’s power (particularly in their area and in the underground). It’s all under the table deals, so people are currently under the assumption that TLH had ended a very long time ago and never exists. TLH stands for “The Last Hope”, which I forgot to mention earlierShenx actually discovered Marian and Khan again through Nea. I mean, Nea was Marian’s daughter that night. so he wasn’t very pleased to find that out.<br />
…<br />
And then there’s Honeycakes.<br />
Honey doesn’t have much to her, so she says.<br />
Born in 3.0’s “humanitarian cloning program”, she was no 3 out of 9. The smaller the number, the older the body skeleton. Honey was born into the body of a 25-year-old male. He’s Omega, he’s the world’s best clone.<br />
Honey had the most of the PRODIGAL CORE inserted into him, giving him insane amounts of strength. With this, he was easily trusted and let into areas she shouldn’t be.<br />
There’s a reason why they try to dampen the intellect of clones nowadays.<br />
Pyrrhon is a scientist.<br />
Like most scientists, she creates experiments.<br />
To test emotional intelligence and bonding under artificial stress. Pyrrhon’s theory: “If we can make even broken clones function as a unit, we can make anyone loyal.”<br />
The Scrapcore unit—Nikita, Adam, Omega, and Kit—were dropped into a controlled “wasteland” sim zone.<br />
Fake urban ruins. No food, minimal gear.<br />
Monitored 24/7. Neural data streamed into Pyrrhon’s labs.<br />
No win condition.<br />
The test was meant to collapse after 30 days, with behavioral breakdowns studied for refinement.<br />
Begin.<br />
INSERT STUFF HERE they get out.
The camera feeds fuzzed. Pyrrhon marked them as “LOST ASSETS.”<br />
But she was still watching.<br />
In the forgotten sector, surrounded by discarded tech, malfunctioning AIs, and broken clone pods, the four made a base. It wasn’t supposed to happen. The system didn’t know what to do with them.<br />
They became something of an urban legend among failed clones: a ghost team. Unstable but free.<br />
They weren’t a rebellion, at least not in Pyrrhon’s eyes. They were a malfunction. She saw Omega’s rebellion not as failure—but defiance. Personal betrayal. So she took it personally.<br />
Pyrrhon decided to test her new weapon: a miniaturized, precision-targeted doomsday laser, a condensed nuke, designed to melt cities from orbit. Testing it on Omega was the perfect test.<br />
Pyrrhon grinned. “Let’s see what hope looks like under 8 trillion kelvin.”<br />
Omega was locked in a containment chamber—torture-level clean, clinical, and pressurized. As most laboratories are.<br />
And the laser fires up.<br />
Omega looks at Pyrrhon.<br />
Pyrrhon only smiles.<br />
the machine whirs in the back, heat gurgling from its engine and seeping out into the tip, ready to—!
--—-
Pyrrhon sat with her torso scratched from falling debris.<br />
Blood trickled down onto the floor.<br />
Her first injury this century.<br />
Omega, carried in the arms of Nikita, went into an escape pod.<br />
But Omega looked back at the moment of the laser’s first test-firing. Even just one glance at the beam’s ignition—through transparent shielding—was enough to permanently destroy his eyesight. Retinas flash-boiled. Optic nerves scorched. A scream cut short by shock.<br />
…</p>
<p>A biotech-enhanced spatial sensor was surgically implanted in her skull. It translates physical surroundings into a 3D representation in her brain—like a sonar map + LIDAR system. It’s “sight,” but not the same. No colors. No light. Only shapes, distance, motion, and pressure. He can, in fact, see, but everything looks like a haunting, low-poly wireframe world.<br />
No longer he be able to gaze into the eyes of<br />
…<br />
Were they his friends in the first place?<br />
They’re on Earth. Now what?<br />
Omega: “We need a chain of command. We do what I say or we die.”<br />
Nikita: “We don’t need a leader. We need a plan. You’re not it.”<br />
Adam: ”You act like we even have a chance.”<br />
Kit: “…”<br />
Fight here<br />
Honey looks around, and sees nothing but a world of everything he’s ever hated.<br />
And he’s sick of it.<br />
One small fight into a small rebellion, now he’s chained up to the wall and tortured until she can barely breathe. Three days until execution.<br />
Honey has one last look at her original form, her mother core.<br />
Two days until execution.<br />
Honey begins to ponder.<br />
One day until execution.<br />
Then, nothing at all.<br />
No one, at least in the general public, knows what happened or where she went; All they know was that 3 PiBots were torn apart and that Pyrrhon— The original war leader Pyrrhon— was injured.<br />
Pyrrhon said she wanted to be there when "Omega's futile resistance fell", and stood right in front of Honey taunting her. But Honey broke out and injured her. The laser was fired and Omega was nowhere to be found and is presumed dead.<br />
No one had ever done that before.<br />
(Insert Adam kit Nikita)<br />
Honey works alone in the CORE equivalent of Baguio (I HEART BAGUIO!!!!!!). She works with a street chef. She goes out to get materials because of her unmatched strength. She brings back fish and works in the farms (steals from the farms) and cuts and prepares them for less than minimum wage. She’s kind of miserable,, her boss treats her badly,,, but also, she’s a clone and clones have extremely bad reputation in that area. Due to construction and lack of funding she can’t get out, so she’s stuck there. Regina goes to her stand to buy some materials. Honey feels bad because Regina is like, 300 php off so she gives her a small piece of candy for free. Her boss did NOT like that!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE IN CRIPPLING FINANCIAL DEBT AND CANT AFFORD THAT!! Honey gets the equivalent of like, public execution with her boss :sob:. The nearby people notice that her muscles and fat are artificial and she just kinda, slumps and hides and continues to skin the fish she just got.<br />
It begins to rain. The train goes down because of it, so she can’t get into her apartment.<br />
“Is this the life I fought to live…?”<br />
This starts her motivation to make sure other people don’t live like she has.<br />
Regina is walking to her restaurant, and she spots Honey sitting there. She offers her an umbrella and Honey just stares at her.<br />
“… That was really good sisig,” says Regina. “Even if you mostly sell fish.”<br />
Honey is flushed and looks to the side.<br />
“Why do you let him treat you like that?”<br />
“I don’t have a chioce. There’s no where else to go. | I’m a clone. You know that. Why do you continue to speak to me?”<br />
“…”<br />
Regina turns to a nearby vendor who’s walking by, selling Taho. She orders two of them and hands one to Honey.<br />
“Repayment,” says Regina. “I got paid earlier.”<br />
Honey takes the Taho without a word, but doesn’t eat it.<br />
Shitty beta I made in 2 seconds<br />
You know,” says Regina. “My place, uh.. I think you’d go well there.”<br />
“Even if my body is 90% metal?”<br />
“What does that matter? | You paid for my meal. You were beaten for it. It’s the least I could do.”<br />
“‘S not yer fault,, what’s the point of gettin’ mad over that?”<br />
“I mean.. if anything, you’ve changed my view on, uh, cloning, and.. we need new recipes there, anyway.”<br />
“Your business will go down if you have me there, I—.. I can’t do that to you, y’ know? | Yer too nice, you don’t deserve that.”<br />
“I’m offering you a job.”<br />
“He’ll kill me.”<br />
“We have protection.”<br />
“…”<br />
“…”<br />
Regina takes off her scarf and wraps it around Honey’s wounds.<br />
“You’re okay,” says Regina. “I’ll help you.”<br />
“Why?”<br />
“Think of it as repayment,” says Regina.<br />
tl;dr<br />
Regina feels bad for her and is like, “you were kinda good at what u do I see ya workin so I think you shoudl get a job, also you shouldn’t let him do that to you” and honey says “but I’m 90% metal” and Regina says “stfu”<br />
So honey is like, eternally grateful ;; the general restaurant is alright, pretty below average but tightly knit. She’s been working there for like, four years?<br />
Around this time, two other suspicious clones began to emerge.<br />
“The lives we’ve left behind,” says Prodigal. “are nothing. They cannot be worth more than what we are about to do.”<br />
Gamma only bites her lip, flicking the visor over her head.<br />
“We will deploy.”<br />
Gamma adjusts the straps on her vest. “We will deploy.”<br />
“You have the map?”<br />
“Yes.”<br />
Prodigal adjusts her helmet, and looks down upon Gamma. Upon FUTURE and everything and everything in the whole wide world.<br />
“Let us begin.”<br />
And with that, Prodigal fell into the abyss, crashing into the depths of hell.<br />
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.. Ta-ta-ta…<br />
Gamma hops off, soaring beneath the dusty clouds, cold air biting her cheeks. Flimsy, plastic wings flick beneath her arms.<br />
“You’re down?”<br />
“At the core!” Says Prodigal. “Get ready to strike at Sector 3– the one Marian lives at!”<br />
“Roger.”<br />
Gamma flicks off her visor, aiming down.<br />
Sector 3– Targeted Area.<br />
Deploy?<br />
Yes No<br />
And Gamma is no more.<br />
Broken glass is all she hears.<br />
Then silence.<br />
One gunshot is all it takes.<br />
Gamma flies, dancing on bullets and fire, piercing through dead bodies. Floating amongst the sea of blood below her.<br />
Ra-ta-ta-ta-ta..<br />
But one gunshot is all it takes.<br />
One gunshot and the whole operation is down.<br />
She tries not to think about that part right now.<br />
A laser grazes her left cheek. Bam! A machine gone.<br />
A machine gun targets her legs. Bam! A master controller, gone.<br />
A door, leading to heavens she may never know. Bam! Open.<br />
There stands Prodigal, already running along the sidelines, dancing along the ceiling like it’s nothing. Like a spider waltzing amongst its web, grasping bullets and slurs and shouts.<br />
She nods at Gamma, who kicks upon the helmet of those beneath her. Bam! Bam! A row taken out, all collapsed into a pathetic pile of limp limbs.<br />
Prodigal only smiles back.<br />
And they work in synergy, as they always had. Two parts of one whole, unified into one sentient God. No bullets, no organizations can stop them now.<br />
Nothing could stop them.<br />
And there! Up in the clouds, the light at the end of the tunnel. The outstretched hand of God which gleamed down beneath them, smiling upon them like the warm sun.<br />
Gamma’s legs ache, gears screaming in protest, needles piercing her throat as she jumps, higher and higher,<br />
Her fingers graze the hinges of the door—<br />
The frame shrieks under her sudden weight, teetering from side to side, wires snapping as Gamma’s arms trembled.<br />
please,<br />
please,<br />
just one more…<br />
just—<br />
just one—!<br />
But one gunshot is all it takes.<br />
She whips around, seeing Prodigal barreling towards her,<br />
Her last hope.<br />
Prodigal’s hands outstretch towards hers,<br />
her metallic skeleton showing from the sudden jump,<br />
her membrane melts off of her skin as she gets closer,<br />
closer,<br />
Gamma’s fingers brush hers, staining them a deep, black color.<br />
BAM!<br />
Suddenly, Prodigal’s head jerks forward, and she’s launched into the wall beneath Gamma.<br />
One bullet—<br />
Gamma lands— hard— on the platform next to Prodigal, which shrieks and trembles under Gamma’s weight.<br />
Prodigal—<br />
From above Prodigal comes a metallic arm, which wraps its hideous tendrils around her neck, piercing her membrane and metal. It’s thumbs worm into her eye sockets as she thrashes, cries out in a broken, warbling shriek. She kicks, screams, cries, bleeds to get it off, to stop it from going down her throat.<br />
My last hope—<br />
From behind Gamma comes footsteps.<br />
God.<br />
She gazes down at Gamma not with disgust, but with curiosity. A subtle humanity deep within her half-lidded eyes.<br />
Gamma can’t move.<br />
Pyrrhon steps closer, heels clacking against the creaky, hollow platform.<br />
She glowers down upon Prodigal,<br />
and grabs her heart.<br />
Never before had Gamma seen something so grotesquely gorgeous.<br />
Pyrrhon’s fingers slide between her membrane, stretching out her titanium ribcage with ease. Prodigal shrieks and whines and screams again, her radio crackling from the sudden stress.<br />
Her hands graze Prodigal’s CORE. Thumping, humming, breathing, loving, LIFE.<br />
THE CORE.<br />
The dim light of Prodigal’s last life shines upon Gamma’s bloodied cheeks.<br />
Time seemed to stop.<br />
it gave off some hideous, electric sensation. Like one that made the hairs on the back of her neck stick up, which made her blood rush, which made her head go dizzy and her chest start to pound. The corners of her vision went blurry, the massacre blending together into one, big, hideous masterpiece.<br />
It didn’t feel real, like patterns in some surreal, drug-induced delirium.<br />
This was the CORE?<br />
It made her sick.<br />
Gamma’s legs jerk up involuntarily, grabbing the attention of Pyrrhon.<br />
She can’t think.<br />
she refuses to.<br />
Her hands find the dampened handles of Pyrrhon’s motorcycle, lurching her deep into the depths of space.<br />
Her eyes meet Pyrrhon’s.<br />
Pyrrhon did nothing.<br />
Only stares,<br />
deep into Gamma.<br />
For the first time in Gamma’s autonomous life,<br />
Gamma felt fear.<br />
and it was the last thing she saw as she went tumbling down into the sweet, gaping maw of the Earth.<br />
Gamma was born into a 16-year-old-female-titanium skeleton within generation 3 ( even though Honeycakes remains to be ~10 years older than her), and is the second youngest clone in that generation outside of Epsilon. She was born prematurely, but is still quite healthy.<br />
She never particularly stood out when fighting for Pyrrhon, except until when she’d left FUTURE. Everyone else kind of ignored the newer g3 clones, and many (like Phi, Chi, and Muse) didn’t even know that they existed.<br />
Because of her general.. being-ignored-thing, she was paired up with another Low-level clone— a cranky old gen-2, half-working piece of scrap metal named Characters/Bosses/Prodigal|Prodigal. Over Gamma’s lifetime (from years 8-17) she grew extremely close to Characters/Bosses/Prodigal|Prodigal, almost to the point of an obsession. Prodigal could have quite honestly cared less. Anyway, one day, Prodigal came up with a full map of FUTURE which had been dropped off of an abandoned hard-drive while she was dumpster diving.<br />
They began hatching a plan, a plan no one had thought of before: to get out of FUTURE once and for all. From 6 months of planning came the great escape from FUTURE. Their life, right in their hands, so close—<br />
As Gamma clung onto the hatch at the ceiling, Prodigal so close—<br />
BAM!!<br />
Gamma made it out alive.<br />
Prodigal did not.<br />
The last thing Gamma saw was the eyes of Pyrrhon, and nothing else, as she crashed into Earth’s surface.<br />
For some odd reason, Gamma couldn’t remember Prodigal’s face when she landed. Nor Prodigal as a concept.<br />
Where was she?<br />
Gamma was saved by Constantine, a lone compsci nerd with nothing else to do but cut himself and weep. From that, she built her career of independent hitman work and bodyguarding and whatnot.<br />
There’s something still that itches her though, and it’s the strange, black, gooey figure who appears in the corner of her vision sometimes.<br />
Constantine was born into a little family in current-day Philipines, up in Bontoc. He lived in a small village, with very little access to technology except for things like fliphones and creaky computers. This is because it rains almost all the time, and most of the houses are made of tar, planks, leaves, metal sheets, etc.<br />
His parents never really let Constantine out of the house. It was against their religion to abort or abandon him, so they just locked him inside of the closet so he wouldn’t rat them out. They got tax benefits, and played it off as, ‘he’s very sick’. He was raised entirely online and by the internet, through chat rooms and such. He spent most of his time on (YouTube), scrolling on social media, involving himself in cheesy old forums, playing old games, etc.<br />
On one particularly bad night, Constantine was almost fatally injured by his father experimenting to make illegal drugs at home. He had walked in at bad times and ended up with awful chemical burns which left his face extremely disfigured and ugly. To cover them up, he wears a welding mask (he does actually know how to weld, since it’s what he does for a living.)<br />
As he got older, he saw a few videos of people doing live surgeries on clones and other machines, and developed such a large hyperfixation for it, he’d actually managed to write and create a master guide for clone, CORE, and Pi-Bot mechanics, due to his extensive research and abundance of time. This was a revolutionary thing, since it’d never been compiled so easily for everyone.<br />
He also got a lot better at coding from this, and eventually got a few jobs (he’d illegally gotten into a few databases for his master list).<br />
As Constantine grew older and more isolated, he built up his online reputation more and more. He works as a mechanic, but also as a blackmailer. his work partner is a girl named XETA, who has a huge crush on him but he’s gay. She was the one who knocked some sense into him about the ‘classic redditor views’ he had.<br />
On another awful night of his, with his hands embedded with glass shards and tinted with blood, he walked out into his backyard with a gun, intending to end his life.<br />
He saw a star in the distant night. Small at first, but then grew into a hideously large explosion right next to him.<br />
As the dust settled, he’d noticed a very small, delicate clone beneath him.<br />
His first instinct was to dissect her, which was exactly what he did. There is a full, well-documented website about this. He did it live while taking great care not to reveal himself (which he kind of did well). He extracted all of the software inside of Gamma since she was intact. It’s rare since they’re usually destroyed on impact by default. He sold the data to some people on the internet, then got quite a bit of money.<br />
After a few days of Gamma sitting there collecting dust, he decided to rebuild her (which wasn’t documented for some reason) and save her.<br />
He didn’t really know what to do with her, and mostly just sent her out to get him food from the outside. They eventually struck a deal which was essentially,<br />
Since you saved my life, I’ll get you away from your parents, which Constantine accepted. From his fundings on the internet, he was sent to a school and got a license to be a mechanic/technician. Gamma left shortly after.<br />
Constantine is actually in horrific debt due to that (he vastly underestimated the cost and kind of got scammed) and is currently evading taxes and running a ‘mechanic shop’ (dark web/blackmail business) to keep himself alive for longer.<br />
Gamma’s a merc, or a mercenary, who does paid work. Despite only being on Earth for such a short period of time, she’s made quite the name for herself! But how..?!<br />
Gamma actually got her ‘big break’ by being scammed. Soon after she left Constantine’s town, she went a bit money crazy and blew her money on dumb shit. just Kidding she wanted cybernetic implants— or at least, ones that wouldn’t identify her as a clone so easily. She found one for an exceedingly good deal— a new charging port, which was almost seamless in her body. You could barely even tell it was there! It barely needed to be oiled and everything! And she didnt sleep on her side, so it’s perfect!<br />
narrator: it was not perfect<br />
Gamma soon found herself in a tub of ice, completely naked, with her clothes torn up and weapons gone.<br />
She’d been kidnapped! They weren’t going to give her Cyberwear, they were going to take hers!<br />
Gamma doesn’t remember much of the incident, or at least that’s what she says. But Rita does.<br />
The first thing that Rita saw was a blood and gut covered ceiling, with weapons and scalpels turned everywhere, and a suspiciously naked little girl in the middle of it.<br />
She’d killed all of the scavengers— and lived to tell the tale. admittedly, Rita’s first thought was not ‘is she okay’ but ‘wow i shoudl hire her!’. And that’s what she did.<br />
Gamma’s been working peacefully with Rita, Moanama, and the other Fixers peacefully ever since.</p></div>
